Naked Ambition and Love on the Rocks director Lam Chiu Yin makes a rather significant departure from his previous works to present the big adventures of a little comrade. Growing up in a time of chaos, carefree village boy Dongzi greatly admires his brave Red Army soldier father and the Red Guards who have protected his village from the evil landlord. When Dongzi's father leaves for the Long March, he gives a sparkling red star to his son. This red star becomes Dongzi's protector in the subsequent years as he encounters numerous hardships and slowly comes of age during the changing tides of wartime China.",
