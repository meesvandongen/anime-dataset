  "synopsis": "An ordinary human named Ah-Ren, suffering from severe social anxiety, transfers to an animal school where \"there are no humans.\" Here, his classmates are all sorts of animals, and even the teachers are rare species like Yangtze alligators and pandas. As an ordinary human, Ah-Ren is completely lost in lessons on spinning silk, nest building, bioluminescence, and molting, gets repeatedly outmatched by the animals in physical education, and even suffers a crushing defeat in academic subjects! Besides, to graduate from this animal school, Ah-Ren needs to complete a special task—to become friends with all the animals on an animal dating app. With this impossible task in mind, a heartwarming and hilarious story unfolds, from initial anxiety to bittersweet farewell.\n\n(Source: iQIYI, Google translated)",
