  "synopsis": "One day, Baikinman finds a picture book. He hears a voice from the book saying, \"Baikinman, warrior of love and courage, come and save me!\" and is sucked into the book. He meets Lulun, a forest fairy, in a large forest beyond the desert. Lulun is scared and can't muster up her courage, so she asks Baikinman to defeat the \"Sucking Elephant\" that is rampaging through the forest. Although she is reluctant at first, Lulun is inspired by Baikinman's refusal to give up and stand up to her. However, she has a hard time with the strength of the Sucking Elephant! In a desperate situation, Baikinman tells Lulun, \"Call Anpanman!\" Anpanman and Baikinman join forces and do great things! \n\n(Source: Official Site, translated)",
