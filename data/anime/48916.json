  "synopsis": "The Nijigasaki High School Idol Club continues to gain popularity as its reputation grows, even catching the attention of aspiring school idol Zhong Lanzhu. However, when Lanzhu visits the club and interacts with its members, she realizes that their ideals differ from her own. This sparks the beginning of a rivalry between Lanzhu and the club members, as she challenges them to see who can captivate a larger audience at the upcoming School Idol Festival. \n\nThus, the school idol club starts a new chapter in its quest to achieve idol stardom. Being more united than ever before, the girls continue to practice for the festival—wanting to show Lanzhu what it truly means to be a school idol.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
