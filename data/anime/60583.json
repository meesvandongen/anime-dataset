  "synopsis": "The young warrior Yun Qingyan disappeared from the world three years ago, but he was actually drawn into the immortal world for three thousand years! With his extraordinary talent, he became the Yun Emperor, one of the ten great immortal emperors. However, because he was tired of the intrigues in the immortal world and missed his family, he decided to return to the mortal world at all costs. \n\nUpon return to the mortal world, his parents and sister strangely disappeared, and due to an incident whilst traveling from the immortal world to the mortal world, he lost his magic weapon and his cultivation became almost zero. Major forces took this opportunity to hunt him down. The immortal emperor became the target of public criticism, and his family was in danger! Yun Qingyan relied on his extraordinary immortal emperor talent to refine pills and array formations, study and practice, and overwhelm his enemies. He embarks on an adventure to revive his family, find his relatives, and rectify the mortal world. \n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
