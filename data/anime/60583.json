  "synopsis": "The young warrior Yun Qingyan disappeared from the world three years ago, but he was actually drawn into the fairy world for three thousand years! With his extraordinary talent, he became the Yun Emperor, one of the ten great fairy emperors. However, because he was tired of the intrigues in the fairy world and missed his family, he decided to return to the human world at all costs. Upon return to the human world, his parents and sister strangely disappeared, and due to an incident whilst traveling from the fairy world to the human world, he lost his magic weapon and his cultivation became almost zero. Major forces took this opportunity to hunt him down. The fairy emperor became the target of public criticism, and his family was in danger! Yun Qingyan relied on his extraordinary fairy emperor talent to refine pills and array formations, study and practice, and overwhelm his enemies. He embarked on an adventure to revive his family, find his relatives, and rectify the mortal world. \n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
