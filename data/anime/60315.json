  "synopsis": "When university students Kuriaki Magi and Yaeko Kirihara witness a man receive a fatal blow to the head, they can barely believe it when he flees the scene unscathed. Once they catch up to the victim, Momoyuki Mogura, they learn that he is immortal.\n\nWhile Magi and Yaeko initially presume Mogura is delusional, their opinion of him changes as they begin seeing apparitions. As Mogura explains, those are spirits of dead people that produce demon fire, a light that guides the spirits after death. Stripped of the right to carry the fire, Mogura has spent years collecting the products from spirits, hoping to one day enter the afterlife. With Magi and Yaeko now helping him find more spirits, the mysterious Mogura may finally achieve his peculiar dream.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
