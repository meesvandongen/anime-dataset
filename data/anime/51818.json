  "synopsis": "After undergoing Benimaru Shinmon's hellish training, Shinra Kusakabe and Arthur Boyle return to Special Fire Force Company 8. However, there is no time to rest: Captain Akitaru Oubi is arrested by the military police under the influence of the White-Clad cult. Moreover, the White-Clad member Haumea—one of the eight pillars who possess Adolla Burst—has successfully brainwashed the leadership of the Tokyo Empire and infiltrated the heart of the firefighting organization. As a result, Shinra and the rest of the Company 8 squad are branded as rebels after they launch a rescue mission to save their captain and ultimately liberate Tokyo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
