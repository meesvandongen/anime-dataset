  "synopsis": "Cornered with no way out, the demon Anthon Juan Basilis falls to what should have been his death. Instead, he plummets into the life of the human Van, marking the start of their bond. From playing games to camping under the stars, the two boys spend time together and grow closer. However, when events from the demon's past resurface, Basilis forces Van to make a choiceâ€”one that threatens the very connection they have nurtured until now.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
