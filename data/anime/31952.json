  "synopsis": "Mizuki Usami is a passionate member of her school's art club, but the club has a problem—Usami is the only member who takes her craft seriously! The lazy club president constantly sleeps through activities and Collette has not regularly attended club activities in quite some time. Subaru Uchimaki, despite being an exceptional artist who could win an award if he tried, is obsessed with drawing the perfect 2D wife.\n\nAs Usami struggles to do art club-like activities, she is often obstructed by her motley crew of good-for-nothings and her distracting crush on Subaru.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
