  "synopsis": "Many years have passed since humanity vanished from Earth, yet the Galaxy Tower hotel in Ginza, Tokyo, continues to operate. At the center of its staff is Yachiyo, a dedicated hotelier robot, along with other employee robots working tirelessly in various departments. Together, they spend what feels like an eternity maintaining the hotel, despite having no guests. As they await the return of their owner and the day humanity reappears.\n\nNow, a small miracle is about to change everything for Yachiyo and her robotic colleagues.\n\n(Source: Official YouTube)",
