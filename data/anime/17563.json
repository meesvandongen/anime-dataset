The DVD included the unedited versions of the project's pilot film, special supplemental videos, and a collection of key animation drawings. The running times of the pilot and the supplemental video collection are each under five minutes long.\n\nNote: The project is on hold due to the dissolution of the production division of its sponsor Ankama Japan.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
