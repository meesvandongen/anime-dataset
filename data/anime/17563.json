  "synopsis": "The doujin (self-published) creators of the Koutetsu no Vendetta (Iron Vendetta) military robot anime project released a preview DVD at Tokyo's Comic Market 75 convention. The DVD included the unedited versions of the project's pilot film, special supplemental videos, and a collection of key animation drawings. The running times of the pilot and the supplemental video collection are each under five minutes long.\n\nNote: The project is on hold due to the dissolution of the production division of its sponsor Ankama Japan.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
