  "synopsis": "Not long after forming their partnership, detectives Ron Kamonohashi and Totomaru Isshiki have proven adept at solving various cases together. However, the two are further motivated to continue their work when they discover that the House of M—an infamous crime syndicate—orchestrated Ron's expulsion from the prestigious Detective Training Academy BLUE five years prior. It appears that this group is also linked to Ron's mysterious ability that causes those around him to lose their lives, a phenomenon which Ron is desperate to stop.\n\nA member of the House of M soon starts to commit boastful serial murders around Shibuya as an act of provocation toward Ron. Consequently, the investigative pair must do their best to apprehend the culprit for the sake of justice as well as learning more about Ron's dark past and present condition.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
