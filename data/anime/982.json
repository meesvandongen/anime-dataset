  "synopsis": "Every cosplay club in Japan shares the same dream: to take first place at the Cosplay World Series. East Oizumi Academy's club is no different; led by Gorou Yorozuyo, the club's members spend every moment training and preparing for competitions. Still, even with ace cosplayer Chako Hasegawa and the shape-shifting powers of the fairy Delmo on their side, the club must work hard if they want to become the best in Japan.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
