  "synopsis": "Rito Sudou, Kotoko Watatsumugi, and Mari Shirako share the same dream: they want their creations to be loved around the world. By combining their different skills, the girls run a small apparel shop named Park in Harajuku. As their fame starts to spread, their lives seem to be going in the right direction.\n\nHowever, their business becomes endangered when aliens dubbed as Scoopers show up on Earth. Due to their lack of creativity, the Scoopers travel around the universe to harvest inventions from other civilizations. As the creatures descend on Harajuku, a young girl named Misa Maruno appears. Claiming she has escaped from the aliens, Misa gives each of the girls a strange device called Amatsumara, which allows its user to create anything they imagine. With the world's artistic future at stake, Rito, Kotoko, and Mari must now defeat the Scoopers with all their imaginative abilities.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
