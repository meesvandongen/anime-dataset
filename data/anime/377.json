  "synopsis": "eX-Driver is set in the future, where all transportation is easily controlled by AI. Though, like all machines, they tend to break down, lose control, or get re-programmed. This is where three high schoolers with non-AI cars—a Subaru WRX, a Caterham Super 7, and a Lotus Europa—come in to save the day and make sure the public is safe at all times. \n\n(Source: ANN, edited)",
