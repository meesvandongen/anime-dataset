  "synopsis": "Himari Kino is a cheerful and outgoing girl who is able to make friends with anyone she wants. When she enrolls in high school and attends the freshman opening ceremony, Himari falls in love with Yori Asanagi, a reserved upperclassman, during Yori's band performance. After the show, Himari blurts out her love, but Yori is inexperienced when it comes to romance.\n\nYori, who did not expect this outcome at all, looks for answers from her friends and music. She decides to respond to Himari's confession, and to her surprise, Yori discovers that Himari fell in love with her music and performance rather than Yori as a person.\n\nDespite the shock, Yori desires to make Himari truly fall in love with her. The duo spend time together after school on the rooftop, where Yori usually plays her guitar with hopes to change Himari's feelings for her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
