  "synopsis": "After the crisis brought forth by the Black Order, Bo City's surviving residents desert the place. With nearby cities providing shelter to the displaced refugees, Mo Fan and his family accept the offer and travel to Mingzhu City, the capital of magic. Mo Fan has little time to settle in when his teacher Tang Yue requests him to assist her with an investigation involving the Black Order. However, Mo Fan agrees only on the condition of having a dark element awakened in him.\n\nAs he steadily attunes to his newfound powers, Mo Fan prepares to enroll at Mingzhu University, a dream place for all magicians. Along the way, Mo Fan's interactions with the elements steadily surpass his expectations, showing him that this is only the beginning of discoveries within his limitless potential.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
