  "synopsis": "Two weeks before a concert at Yaon Hibiya auditorium (1987.8.26), while playing at the club Shinjuku Loft, lead vocalist To-Y (pron: to-o-i) of the band GASP is jumped by a rival, Aikawa Yoji. GASP is a upcoming band known for its violence, struggling to be noticed against the popularity of hotshot Aikawa, who's #1 on the charts and beloved by his fans. The Yaon Hibiya concert represents GASP's mainstream debut to break out of the small-time club scene, which is threatened by the schemes of Aikawa's manager, Ms. Kato of Koyama Productions. Kato wants To-Y to leave that \"bunch of hoodlums,\" and sing independently for a major label. \n\nAdding to the confusion is an unexplained character who manifests feline traits, named Niya. Niya presents herself as \"To-Y's aijin\" (\"Niya, To-Y no aijin da yo!\") to the consternation of Koishikawa Hiderou, who has interest in To-Y. Koishikawa, also known as \"Sonoko-chan,\" is typed as a \"okama\" by Niya. A running motif is GASP, it's fans, and associates regarded as unusual by the mainstream public, as exemplified by their musical taste, dress, and Classic Coke-drinking, which only contributes to more difficulty in their struggle to be accepted.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
