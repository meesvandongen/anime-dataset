  "synopsis": "To-Y Fujii is the frontman of GASP, a band rapidly growing in popularity in Tokyo's underground punk scene. Just when it seems like the band has gotten their big break and booked a major venue, an executive from the large Koyama Productions tries to scout To-Y as a solo act. Unwilling to abandon his bandmates, he boldly declares that he does not need Koyama's support. However, when the spurned executive starts to put obstacles in their way, To-Y must decide if his integrity is worth holding on to.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
