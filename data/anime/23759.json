  "synopsis": "The sun rises, but snow begins to fall immediately. Two rabbits wearing skis emerge from two houses covered in snow. The two rabbits go to wake Tanuko, the sleepy raccoon dog, and invite him to go skiing. Tanuko, who does not know how to ski, is apprehensive at first, but decides to take up the challenge after watching the rabbits skillfully ski down the slope. Tanuko nervously goes down the slope. On his first attempt, he falls flat on his back. On his second attempt, he goes too fast, causing his legs and skis to detach from his body. The rabbits decide to show off by doing a ski jump. Tanuko, feeling competitive, sits on an umbrella and speeds down the hill. The umbrella turns into a plane and he soars through the sky. Seeing this, the two rabbits' bodies join and turn into a sleigh. They proceed to chase Tanuko. Tanuko's mouth turns into propellers, and he picks up speed. The rabbits go too fast and end up tripping over. Tanuko, while laughing at this, crashes into a cliff and gets buried in snow.\n\n(Source: Japanese Animated Film Classics)",
