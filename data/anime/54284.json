  "synopsis": "Third-generation VTuber Awayuki Kokorone's fans know her as a prim, proper, and graceful idol. Though she has considerably less fans compared to other VTubers in the Live-On agency, Awayuki's loyal following supports her every step of the way.\n\nOne night, Awayuki forgets to turn her livestream off—a blunder that changes the trajectory of her online career forever. Contrary to her usual angelic persona, her genuine brutish personality is exposed to more than ten thousand people who tuned in. Awayuki reveals that she is nothing more than a severe alcoholic who spouts profanities nonstop, constantly viewing her fellow VTubers with lustful admiration.\n\nHowever, instead of being reprimanded by her agency, Awayuki receives praise: her unhinged, disorderly conduct was Live-On's actual expectation of her. Now having her big break and permission to stream without holding anything back, the once-unpopular VTuber begins her rise to stardom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
