  "synopsis": "The Inter-High has finally arrived for Karasuno High School's volleyball team. Their opponent at the tournament is Date Tech High School—the team that crushed Karasuno the year prior. The loss brings back anxiety and fear for the team's second- and third-years as they were unable to overcome Date's \"read block.\" With the dynamic freshmen duo Shouyou Hinata and Tobio Kageyama on their side, will Karasuno be able to overcome their past and break through the iron wall?\n\nAwaiting Karasuno in the next round is the elite Aoba Jousai High School, led by the cunning captain Tooru Oikawa. Coming from the same middle school as Kageyama, Oikawa is a talented and unpredictable setter with a grudge against his former teammate. It is a battle between genius setters to decide who will continue on in the Inter-High.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
