Entrusting him with the mystical \"Egg of the Roof,\" she implores Palme to take it to the legendary realm of Tamas.\n\nGalvanized with purpose for his existence, he accepts Koram's quest to deliver the relic to its source: the center of the planet, which is threatened by a malevolent and destructive force.\n\n(Source: ADV Films)",
