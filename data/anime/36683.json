  "synopsis": "A theater manners short bundled with the recap movie's BD/DVD releases. Each film had its own short with slight differences (eg. Fushisha no Ou had a smiling Shalltear but the Shikoku no Eiyuu one showed her sneering). Due to the minimal changes between the two, resulting in only a few seconds of alternative footage, MAL will reflect it as a single episode as the blunt majority was identical.",
