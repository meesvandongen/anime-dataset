  "synopsis": "Second-year high schooler Tamao Tsukamu, a short and perverted boy, is hopelessly in love with his senior and fellow kendo club member, Kiritani Konome. Beautiful, accomplished, and adored by all, she seems like the perfect romantic interest for Tamao. Yet there is just one issue: Kiritani is already engaged to the giant of a man who is the student council president!\n\nWhen Kiritani summons Tamao to the student council room, the president extends him an invitation to the yearbook committee. However, Tamao will not be helping with the regular album—instead, he will be contributing to a secret section composed of revealing photos of the female students.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
