  "synopsis": "As usual, the train was packed. The girl sitting in her seat gives her seat to an old man. But then another one came. By portraying the sufferers in the midst of the mundane, the film asks the question of \"suffering\" and what kindness is in the modern age. This work is an animation of the world of a song sung by Wataru Takada based on a poem by Hiroshi Yoshino.\n\n(Source: Official website)",
