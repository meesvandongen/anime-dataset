  "synopsis": "Poron/Polon is an alien child who comes in a flying saucer from the distant reaches of space to Earth. There, he soon encounters the native life-forms, although as a new arrival, he is unaware that he has ignored humans, and instead befriends a rabbit, a bear, and a fox. This little-known science fantasy is not to be confused with Chobin the Starchild, which started its TV run a month earlier. \n\n(Source: animevice) ",
