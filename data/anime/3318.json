  "synopsis": "After a three-year coma due to a car accident, Haruka Suzumiya finally leaves Keyaki General Hospital. The young woman slowly gets accustomed to the outside world thanks to the warmth of her loving family and caring boyfriend Takayuki Narumi—who broke up with the girlfriend he had made during Haruka's hospitalization so that he could pursue his former love.\n\nHowever, afraid to be a burden to Takayuki, Haruka suggests breaking up with him and then abandons him in a departing train. More determined than ever to start a career in picture book writing, Haruka devotes herself to studying for the university admission exam. At the same time, Takayaki tries to land a stable job despite the lasting economic depression. Although they pursue seemingly different goals, will Takayuki and Haruka be able to ultimately reunite?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
