  "synopsis": "Eternal Family is the most popular reality show in the world, where five societal dropouts live together with an actor. From people with eccentric personalities or sordid pasts to abandoned children, these displaced individuals were implanted with false memories to believe the six of them formed a family. While their memories have been overwritten, the characteristics that made them outcasts of society remain, fueling an incredibly chaotic lifestyle. But when an accident leads to the breakdown of the facility detaining them, the family becomes loose on the streets. Now that they have a taste of the outside world, returning to their captivity may be an impossible feat.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
