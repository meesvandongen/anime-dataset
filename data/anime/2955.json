  "synopsis": "Etsuko Yamanobe is the most popular newscaster at Tokyo Flower Television thanks to her blatant disregard for morals and ethics. To beat her competitors, this crafty woman will resort to even the shadiest, most questionable methods. She has eyes only for fame and fortune, with everything—and everyone—else being secondary.\n\nDuring a slow week, Etsuko catches wind of an ongoing hostage situation: Marude Damesuke has recently been fired and is seeking revenge by taking out his anger on his former boss' daughter, Mayumi Wakabayashi. Etsuko hurries to the scene, but is upset to discover that the situation between Damesuke and the police has reached a standstill. With both sides too afraid to take action, Etsuko creates her own scenario—even if it means using her body and the lives of others.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
