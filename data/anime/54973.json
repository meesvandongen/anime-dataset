  "synopsis": "Liang Xigua is a poor young man struggling to make a living in the cracks of the city. One day, his old refrigerator, which had been with him for many lonely summers, took on a human form and intervened in his life. They confront each other over food, struggle to make ends meet, drag each other down, and support each other, resulting in lots of ludicrous daily stories. Xigua gradually realizes that he is not the only one who has awakened the life of the appliance.\n\n(Source: Bilibili)",
