  "synopsis": "After a severe scolding from her mother, 15-year-old high school student Jasmine rushes to class in hopes of making it on time. But when a strange storm suddenly hits, lightning strikes down on Jasmine and renders her unconscious. Instead of waking up in the hospital, the girl opens her eyes to a cute, dog-eared boy named Longjing. What's more, Jasmine realizes she now possesses a pair of fluffy cat ears!\n\nFiguring she simply has a case of amnesia, Longjing offers to help guide Jasmine around the Tea Continent. Little does he know, she is more than excited to explore this RPG-styled world and fulfill her apparent destiny as the main character.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
