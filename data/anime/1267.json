Are the Troopers merely puppets in some cosmic play, acting out parts? \n\nWho is this mysterious Suzunagi, a mysterious girl who entices each of the warriors with their hearts’ desire - salvation, new armors, freedom from a life of fighting. Why is she so interested in the troopers and their armors?\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
