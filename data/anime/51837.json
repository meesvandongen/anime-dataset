  "synopsis": "The maid Lilith, hired to look after young Yuuri and his family's mansion, seems highly suspicious: she is too good to be true. Every dish she serves turns out to be delicious, the whole residence sparkles after she cleans it, and all the clothing has given off a pleasant scent since she started doing the laundry. Furthermore, her devilishly beautiful eyes only serve to heighten Yuuri's suspicions. Is Lilith perhaps a witch or a sorcerer? Yuuri cannot figure it out.\n\nBut despite his misgivings, Yuuri has to live with Lilith as he tries to unravel the mystery behind her otherworldly charm.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
