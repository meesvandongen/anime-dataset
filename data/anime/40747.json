No matter who the feelings are toward, no matter what form it takes, all love and lifestyles have the same value. An omnibus anime tells the stories of \"The wedding of an ex,\" \"a student and a teacher at an all-boys' school,\" and \"childhood friends whose bodies and hearts change with adolescence.\"\n\n(Source: Kotonoha, edited)",
