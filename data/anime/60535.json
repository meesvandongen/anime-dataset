  "synopsis": "The story follows Hajime Sekiguchi, a former life insurance salesman who, in a moment of desperation, makes the unexpected leap into the world of hosts.\n\nAt Club One, Hajime finds himself surrounded by a cast of eccentric personalities: a \"younger brother\" type host with 20 years of experience, a former idol specializing in romantic sales tactics, and a hyper-aggressive host obsessed with mobile games. Despite thinking, \"This isn't a job for anyone with a sane mind,\" Hajime uses his polished insurance sales skills to attract clients and carve out a surprising niche for himself.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
