  "synopsis": "Driven by conflicting interest groups, the anti-magic movement is gaining dangerous momentum. Warned by the Yotsuba family, Tatsuya Shiba takes countermeasures to foil the plans of crooked politicians and corrupt journalists. He repels the first attack, which framed First High School as an unofficial venue for military education, but his most formidable enemies have yet to act. If Tatsuya wants to preserve his peaceful life with his sister, Miyuki, he must demonstrate once more that no one in the world can outsmart him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
