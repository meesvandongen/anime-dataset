  "synopsis": "In the near future, civilization has collapsed, and the world has become a wasteland. Despite their poverty, the people use remnants of past civilizations to lead resilient lives. Gear works in a junk shop while also retrieving stolen goods alongside Qu-0213, a robot with four personalities, and White Bear, a gambler. One day, Gear finds himself thrust into a once-in-a-lifetime job to steal an important item. They soon find themselves up against deadly assassins, heart- pounding car chases, and explosive battles. What Gear and his team do not know yet is that the item they stole holds a secret that could shake the very foundation of this world.\n\n(Source: Disney+)",
