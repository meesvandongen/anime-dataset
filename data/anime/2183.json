  "synopsis": "Ayane Mitsui dreams of becoming a professional wrestler, and trains hard in hopes of facing her idol Manami Toyota at the All-Japan Women's International Championship. However, she is devastated when she fails her tryout for All-Japan Pro Wrestling. Seeing her potential, a man under the guise of representing an indie promotion scouts her out. The man who scouted her turns out to be Kunimitsu Tangay, a veteran trainer.\n\nEagerly accepting the invitation, Ayane initially believes she is being trained in strong style wrestling—but is shocked when Kunimitsu signed her up for a kickboxing match instead! With her pride on the line, Ayane pushes through, even though she lacks passion in her newfound sport.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
