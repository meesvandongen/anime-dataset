  "synopsis": "Follow-up to the original Go! Go! Vehicle Zoo. This series is more of the same, but introduces a couple new characters. There's the newest Vehicle Zoo pair, a dog named Moko who specializes in tracking, and her partner, a fire truck named Fine. And there's also Guutan, a chaotic unidentified creature who's the closest thing this show has to a villain. He's a lot of fun.",
