  "synopsis": "A chance encounter between young Tang Zhi and a dragon maiden unexpectedly awakened his \"Heavenly Eye\"—allowing him to see gods and spirits roaming the mortal realm. These unique eyes led him into a world that coexisted with the mundane. Through unforgettable experiences, Tang Zhi made friends with all sorts of people and experienced laughter and warmth in seemingly ordinary yet subtly wondrous daily moments. An ordinary scholar, encountering and accompanying a group of gods and spirits with diverse personalities amidst the everyday life of the mortal world—this story of adventure, friendship, and growth is slowly unfolding.\n\n(Source: Bangumi, translated)",
