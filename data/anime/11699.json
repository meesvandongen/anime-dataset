  "synopsis": "Yurume Aida has settled into her life at the Maison du Wish, a boarding house full of young students hoping to pass college entrance exams despite rarely progressing in their studies. When Sae Kawano's younger sister moves into the house as a last-ditch effort to get Sae to buckle down, the residents' lazy lifestyle is threatened. Now deep within their ranks, Sae's sister may be the missing piece that can turn this group of misfits around—as long as she can resist the urge to succumb to their slothful ways.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
