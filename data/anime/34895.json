  "synopsis": "Setsuna Shiraha has loved her childhood friend Ginta Akaishi for a very long time. Her feelings for him are immensely strong, having grown to the point where she masturbates while smelling his used shirts. One unfortunate night, however, when Shiraha is touching herself in the locker room, her teacher Kuroki catches her red-handed, blackmails her, and proceeds to force himself on her. Being helpless, Shiraha cannot do anything but endure the pain and suffering—lest both her and Akaishi's reputations be forever tarnished.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
