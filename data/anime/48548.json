  "synopsis": "Fuutarou Uesugi's efforts as the Nakano quintuplets' private tutor are finally paying off. The academic performances of the five sisters are steadily improving, and they are each closer than ever to achieving their respective dreams. However, it appears that Fuutarou has become more than a teacher for the girls, who urge him to sort out his feelings.\n\nThe undecided young man promises to make a decision by the end of the school festival. However, Fuutarou's task will not be easy, as the Nakano sisters pull out all the stops to win his heart before it is too late.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
