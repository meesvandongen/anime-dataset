Because he is constantly being henpecked at home, he becomes involved in an affair with a cute typist at his company and accidentally tells his wife about it while talking in his sleep. After obtaining additional evidence of the affair, she goes to confront both her husband and the typist at her husband's office.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
