  "synopsis": "Yui Ichii, Yuzuko Nonohara, and Yukari Hinata form a peculiar friend group; even though each girl is eccentric in their own way, they get along. Now entering high school, the friends are looking forward to the next few years together while also wanting to be a part of something bigger. When they stumble across the data processing club without any members and in danger of disbanding, they immediately decide to join it.\n\nAs the club's newest members, Yui, Yuzuko, and Yukari spend their time doing wordplays, teasing each other, and using computers to search for topics to have amusing conversations about. The girls' daily lives never get dull as they enjoy their time at school to the fullest.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
