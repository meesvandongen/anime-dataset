  "synopsis": "As the seasons pass by, the end of Mochizou Ooji's third and final school year quickly approaches. He aims to study at a university in Tokyo, but at the cost of leaving behind his loved ones—including his beloved childhood crush, Tamako Kitashirakawa. Having no such plans for the future, Tamako will merely remain in town to work at her family's humble mochi shop.\n\nAs the time for Mochizou's departure draws closer, the reserved young man must gather up the courage to confess his feelings to Tamako before it is too late—lest his love go unnoticed forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
