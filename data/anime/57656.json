  "synopsis": "Jun Xie, a legendary ace agent feared by all, suffered an accident during a mission and was reborn in the Xuanxuan Continent as Jun Moxie, the infamous and utterly useless young master of the Tianxiang Kingdom. His family is now mired in trouble and facing numerous crises. Though his body is now a useless shell, he remains a king in this life, and will continue to do so in this new world! He will roam the martial world, wielding his sword, caring not who reigns supreme; for him, a late-night snack is nothing more than a pot of turtle soup.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
