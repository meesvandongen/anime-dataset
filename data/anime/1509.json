  "synopsis": "Nina Yamada's greatest dream is to find someone that will protect her in the same way the princesses are in her storybooks. She soon desperately needs that protection: when she swallows a strange pink ball of what she believes to be hard candy, a huge number of people fall from the sky. The ball she swallowed is the Crystal Pearl, a symbolic trinket that magic users from another world fight over. The winner of the Crystal Pearl passes a magic exam that can grant them the prestigious title of professional wizards.\n\nZero and Ichii, two young men taking the exam together, quickly determine that the pearl is inside Nina and promise to protect her until the exam is over. With countless other examinees after the object, their task is daunting—but not as brutal as the embarrassment Nina faces when she arrives at school with two handsome boys at her heels.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
