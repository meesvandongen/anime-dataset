  "synopsis": "Every Thursday, Shuchiin Academy student council secretary Yuu Ishigami can be found in a state of anxiety. He counts down the hours until he can escape to the student council chamber to read the latest chapter of the popular seinen manga series, \"Momo Doesn't Think.\" Joining Ishigami in his weekly reading, student council president Miyuki Shirogane swiftly grows excited at the news of a third season of the manga's anime adaptation.\n\nHowever, it is only a matter of time before vice president Kaguya Shinomiya discovers what has been engrossing the two boys. With the stigma of being labeled an otaku looming over his head, Shirogane must do everything he can to keep his embarrassing secret from coming to light.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
