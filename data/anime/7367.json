To make matters worse, the trio is ambushed by mysterious ninjas who capture Sakura, prompting Naruto and Sasuke to give chase.\n\nAs the two boys engage in a dangerous battle, not even Sasuke's troubling discovery about the mission can deter them from their endeavor to reunite the team and accomplish their task.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
