  "synopsis": "Suzunaru no Kirikabu \nOn a hot summer day, Takashi Natsume and his feline companion Madara take a walk to buy jelly. Suddenly a truck passes the two, running over an old, masked man who asks Natsume for help. The mysterious individual turns out to be a youkai, the spirit of the Suzunaru tree that was recently hit by lightning and cut down. As the tree withers away, the youkai requests Natsume to fulfill his one final wish: to bring him water every day until he draws his last breath.\n\nMugen no Kakera \nTamami, a young schoolgirl, counts her steps through a forest, following instructions on a piece of paper. She stops to take a break and falls asleep but is awakened by an odd talking cat. Through meeting the cat and his human partner, Natsume, she learns that the forest has its own separate world from the contemporary, where one can see things otherwise invisible. Putting her trust in the duo, Tamami tells them about the story of how she helped a white owl that reappeared in her dreams to lead her back inside the bizarre forest.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
