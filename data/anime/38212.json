  "synopsis": "On a night out with coworkers, the new clothes designer Minori Aizawa and her boss, Akihiko Hadano, engage in their usual lighthearted banter. Carried away, they miss the last train and end up having to share a small capsule hotel room. Both tipsy and in close proximity, the two cannot deny their unmistakable attraction to one another, and they spend the night together.\n\nAlthough such intimacy was not in Aizawa's or Hadano's original plan, keeping their hands to themselves grows harder as they work together. In every stolen moment alone, Aizawa and Hadano give in to their deepest desires and dive into the world of pleasure.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
