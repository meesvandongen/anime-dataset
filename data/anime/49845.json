  "synopsis": "On March 11, 2011, a massive earthquake of magnitude 9.0 hit the Tohoku region. The Tomita Diner family evacuates from place to place, leaving their 8-year-old dog, Gonta, behind. Meanwhile Yoshino, a female university student in Tokyo, joins a pet rescue volunteer group and goes to the disaster area. There, she rescues a dog and names him Peace, but he is found to be suffering from a serious illness and is diagnosed as having only one month to live. Yoshino desperately tries to bring Peace back to his original owner. Miraculously, Yoshino meets the Tomita family and learns that Peace is Gonta. Gonta continues to live to the point that even doctors are surprised, and becomes a hope for many victims. Yoshino also becomes increasingly involved in pet rescue, which she had a reason for.\n\n(Source: Otakuthon)",
