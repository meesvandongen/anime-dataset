  "synopsis": "When university student Zhang Chulan returns to his home village, he is devastated to learn that his grandfather Zhang Xilin's grave has been desecrated. As he investigates the cemetery in search for clues, he is attacked by a tomb raider using the false identity of Zhang Xilin's granddaughter. Left to die in a swarm of zombies summoned by the person who spirited his grandfather's body away, Zhang Chulan manages to escape thanks to qi, the power that his grandfather taught him.\n\nWhen Zhang Chulan returns to his uneventful student life, he is shocked to again meet the tomb raider, Feng Baobao, who condemned him to a grim fate. Affiliated with a state organization tasked with handling outcasts known as qi wielders, Baobao forces him to join a delivery company that acts as a front for their true pursuits.\n\nAs various factions clash to seize the mysterious power Zhang Chulan is said to have inherited from his grandfather, the young man must learn how to choose his allies if he wants to survive in this dangerous world of outcasts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
