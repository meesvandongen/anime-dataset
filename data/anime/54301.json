  "synopsis": "Ever since he published a picture that sparked a wave of online harassment, freelance photographer Kouya Madoka has lost everything: his wife Saeko Yukihira, his confidence, and his courage to photograph people. However, years later, a job offer introduces him to the exhilarating world of Formula 4 (F4). A single fierce battle between the amateur drivers in the junior category of open-wheel car racing becomes enough to make Madoka unable to put his camera down.\n\nWhen Komaki Motors' Haruka Asahina bursts into tears on the track, Madoka manages to capture this vulnerable moment. This photo eventually leads Madoka to an impulsive decision: he will help sponsor both the Komaki team and Haruka himself. But the unreasonable costs of the sport quickly cause Madoka to reassess his ambitions, and he seeks different ways to support the severely underfunded F4 team. Despite the uphill battle, Madoka's determination for Haruka to succeed may be the trigger that can propel the young driver straight to the top.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
