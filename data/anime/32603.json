  "synopsis": "Some time has passed since student council president Ui Wakana and vice president Hayato Izumi got married due to the agreement their parents made. While they still try to avoid unnecessary attention by keeping their unusual relationship a secret from the public, the two frequently misunderstand each other's desires. However, as Ui and Hayato continue working in the school's student council and spending time together at home, the peculiar couple gradually grows closer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
