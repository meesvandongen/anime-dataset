  "synopsis": "Parents who don't want to take care of their child leave parenting to the mail ordered robot \"Auto Mommy\" and allow their child to be raised in isolation.\n\nOne day, they take a look at the monitor to check the child, and then they see the child wearing dog skin and hiding his face. This is not good, the parents think, because they can't send the child to school like this. So they make Auto Mommy peel the dog skin off the child, only to find that the child became a plant without a human face.",
