  "synopsis": "Fourth season of Boonie Bears.\n\nNow that spring is in the air, the forest animals are back to frolicking amongst the freshly blooming flowers and busy at work planting new trees to add even more color to their luscious home. The bear brothers—Briar and Bramble, and all their friends are having a jolly great time basking in this colorful season; however, from time to time, they stumble across Logger Vick who will not give up. The bears, along with their little friends make it their mission to protect the forest. This always results in a lot of laughter, tears and of course, adventures aplenty!\n\n(Source: Official website)",
