  "synopsis": "The protagonist, Lin Feng, was originally a genius robotics engineer. To enhance the capabilities of his super-powered robot, he painstakingly unearthed a mysterious ancient treasure from the abyss—the Eye of the Ancestral Dragon. Just as he was about to transfer the Eye's energy into his robot, the divine power within was accidentally activated, triggering a spacetime vortex that transported Lin Feng to an ancient god-like continent that revered martial arts, where he was reborn. \n\nThe reborn Lin Feng had his memories of his past life sealed, becoming an ordinary person who only awakened a healing-type martial soul. He faced cold shoulders and even had his fiancee break off their engagement. His fiancee's clan, determined to eliminate any future threats, ruthlessly attacked and killed him. In this moment of crisis, Lin Feng awakened his memories of the Eye of the Ancestral Dragon and was overjoyed to discover that its divine power had successfully fused with his super-powered robot. Subsequently, with the robot's assistance, he gradually mastered the Eye of the Ancestral Dragon's power and embarked on the path to becoming a powerful figure.\n\n(Source: Bangumi, translated)",
