  "synopsis": "The Carrot Military Service special unit, Cat Shit One, is an elite private military fighting force. Members Perkins and Botasky are stationed in the Middle East to conduct reconnaissance on an insurgent base where hostages are being held. However, things quickly escalate when the enemies kill a hostage and mercilessly torture another. Realizing that they cannot wait for their requested backup to arrive, the vastly outnumbered pair of rabbit mercenaries decide to rescue the captives themselves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
