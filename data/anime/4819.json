So when Takumaro lands a case at Nonomura Hospital (famous for its hot nurses), it seems like a match made in Heaven. \n\nNow somewhere between his busy schedule of pick-up lines and peeking at the nurses' panties, Takumaro must uncover the truth behind the death of the hospital's president. Was it really a suicide or was it cold-blooded murder? \nThe nurses aren't talking and everyone seems to be hiding something. But Takumaro isn't worried - his biggest challenge is to make it with that cute redhead, or die trying! ",
