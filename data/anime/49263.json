  "synopsis": "The conclusion of the Mino ware contest has spurred Himeno Toyokawa to create a piece even more remarkable than the last. Anxious to embrace the future yet emboldened by her mother's legacy, Himeno strives to find the right inspiration—a task that proves to be just as ambitious as her goal. When Himeno's father suggests that her next creation should be the centerpiece at the cafe, expectations for the final product only grow with each passing day.\n\nThrough new encounters and experiences, Himeno and her friends reconnect with the foundation of their passion in their search for what lies at the core of pottery.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
