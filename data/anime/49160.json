  "synopsis": "Fushihara-san spends most of her time stuck in front of her office computer, regularly toiling at overtime like a corporate slave, even after all her coworkers have gone home. Noticing her unhealthy situation, a ghost in the form of a little girl rumored to haunt the building takes it upon herself to scare Fushihara-san out of the office in order to relieve her stress. However, the ghost's overwhelming cuteness only does the opposite and instead motivates Fushihara-san to work even more. Even so, the presence of this adorable soul will only bring more positivity and happiness to Fushihara-san's life as the two spend more time together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
