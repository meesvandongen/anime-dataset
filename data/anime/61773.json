  "synopsis": "Through her college years, Sam Young devoted hours upon hours to developing her adventure puzzle game, Ruminate. Despite being very ill as a child, Sam aspires to become a true game developer. But when her favorite gaming streamer, Marshall Law, tests the game, he horribly misunderstands it and declares it the worst game he has ever played. As a result, his fans bombard Sam's game with negative reviews, jeopardizing her dreams.\n\nTo make matters worse, Marshall moves in as Sam's new neighbor, unaware that she is the developer he so harshly criticized. Although he appears caring and kind, she struggles to befriend him. Before she can develop her second game, Evermake, Sam must first figure out a way to repair her ruined reputation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
