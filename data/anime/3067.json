The Yamato makes its final journey to save the Earth from this new threat.\n\nEarth has almost recovered from the battle against Gamilus, and reconstruction has expanded to the other planets. When former Yamato crew-mates discover a strange, garbled message that seems to be coming from a white comet headed towards Earth, they hijack their old space fortress and begin a new battle.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",
