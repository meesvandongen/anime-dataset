  "synopsis": "Tactical Dolls, or \"T-Dolls\", are militarized androids that rivals the strengths of human soldiers. These T-Doll girls are unstoppable fighters on the battlefield who can engage in any risky operations given to them. Although ruthless warriors in combat, they become more playful and joyful dolls in the dormitories. The daily lives of eight T-Dolls are followed along with cute interactions, lively games, ranting commanders, and many other wholesome events deployed right at your front lines.\n\n[Written by Zattochi4]",
