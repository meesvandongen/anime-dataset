  "synopsis": "Chen Xing is the young master of the Chen family in Dongyang City. Both his parents died. He could have succeeded him as the head of the family when he came of age, but was plotted and plotted by the ambitious acting head of the family, Chen Sheng, to occupy the magpie nest. \n\nWho would have thought that Chen Xing would survive the catastrophe, accidentally obtain the long-lost supreme skill \"The Ancient Star God Art\", and learn some of the moves, come back strong, expose Chen Sheng's ugly face, and imprison him. The matter was put aside for the time being. Chen Xing took precautions and carefully studied the \"Ancient Star God Technique\" to collect the star beasts needed for the technique and grow rapidly. \n\nDuring this period, Chen Xing rescued Mu Qinglan, the daughter of the palace lord of Xuanyang Palace, because of a star beast, and on her advice, she went through all kinds of hardships to enter Xuanyang Palace. However, as soon as he started, Chen Xing had constant disputes with Jian Feikong, the son of the deputy sect leader.\n\n(Source: Youku, translated)",
