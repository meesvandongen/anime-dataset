  "synopsis": "Tezuka × Atobe ÷ Koharu\nFudomine Middle School's tennis captain, Kippei Tachibana, asks rival school captains Kunimitsu Tezuka, Keigo Atobe, and Kuranosuke Shiraishi to assist him with his team's practice. Shiraishi's teammate, Koharu Konjiki, decides to tag along in hopes of being able to see his crush. Instead, Konjiki ends up becoming infatuated with both Tezuka and Atobe and struggles to pick between the two.\n\nFuji Kyoudai no Houkago (Fuji Brothers After School)\nSeishun's Shuusuke Fuji asks his younger brother Yuuta to go shopping with him to pick out a present for their older sister's birthday. As they proceed with their plans, Yuuta's teammates from the St. Rudolph Academy tennis team catch a glimpse of the two brothers and initially think nothing of it. However, St. Rudolph's manager, Hajime Mizuki, misinterprets the situation and believes Shuusuke is trying to get Yuuta to transfer back to Seishun. In an effort to stop his plans, Hajime forces the team to secretly follow the brothers around.\n\nInitial A\nRikkai University-Affiliated Middle School's Akaya Kirihara always seems to get himself into sticky situations. Out on a shopping trip with Bunta Marui and Jackal Kuwahara, Kirihara bumps into Seishun's Takashi Kawamura, causing a stuffed toy Kawamura was carrying to go flying into a nearby dog's mouth. The two begin to chase the dog in order to get the toy back. Kawamura later recounts the story to Yamabuki Middle School's Jin Akutsu, who seems less than enthused about the ordeal.\n\nKai☆Para\nSeishun's Eiji Kikumaru shows up to morning tennis practice tired after staying up late at night to play Kai☆Para, a new online game. Vice-captain Shuichirou Oishi seems perplexed by the concept of an online game, which shocks his teammates. Eiji convinces his doubles partner to log onto the game later that night but fails to tell him the full name of the game, causing Oishi to play a different game instead that uses the same moniker.\n\nNagisa no Motemote Watching (Beachside's Popular Watching)\nRokkaku Middle School's tennis captain, Kentarou Aoi, is jealous of his teammate Kojirou Saeki and Yamabuki's Kiyosumi Sengoku, both of whom can effortlessly attract women. Overhearing his troubles, Shitenhouji's Konjiki decides to tell him the secrets to winning over a woman's heart.\n\nOmae no Kimochi ga Wakaranai (I Don't Understand Your Feelings!)\nAfter coming to afternoon practice late, Hyoutei Academy's Choutarou Ootori accidentally overhears the team's third years discussing who will become the captain once they graduate. Ootori's doubles partner, Ryou Shishido, states that between him and Wakashi Hiyoshi, he would choose Hiyoshi to lead Hyoutei. This upsets Ootori greatly and the two end up fighting during practice. In an effort to cool down, Shishido sets out to train on his own but runs into Seishun's Kaoru Kaidou, who offers his two cents on his situation.\n\nDocchi no Megane Show (Whose Glasses Are These?)\nAfter knocking over a display stand, Higa Middle School's Yuujirou Kai bumps into Hyoutei's Hiyoshi, knocking his contact right out of his eye. As Hiyoshi searches for his missing contact, his teammate Yuushi Oshitari and Seishun's Sadaharu Inui begin to argue over what type of glasses would best suit him.\n\nUnabara-matsu! (The Ocean Festival)\nSeishun's Ryouma Echizen and Takeshi Momoshiro are invited by Rikkai's Genichirou Sanada to their school's Ocean Festival. The tennis team is putting on a \"Cinderella\" play for the festival with Kirihara playing the main role, though the second-year ace is reluctant to be wearing a frilly pink dress for the part.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
