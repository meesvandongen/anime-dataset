  "synopsis": "After a disastrous romantic confession, Masamune Okumura finds solace in the fictional world of anime and manga. Now a second-year high school student and the president of the Manga Research Club, Masamune spends a peaceful existence watching the adventures of the angel Liliel, his favorite character.\n\nIn the beginning of the academic year, Masamune’s life is turned upside down when he meets first-year student Ririsa Amano, a passionate cosplay practitioner. Despite Masamune's initial reluctance, the determined young woman manages to convince him to become her personal photographer for the production of a collection dedicated to their common favorite character: Liliel.\n\nAs Masamune enthusiastically discovers the world of cosplay and photo editing, he is unexpectedly reunited with his childhood friend Mikari Tachibana, who has become a model in the hope of impressing her beloved upperclassman. Realizing that modeling is not enough to intrigue the hopeless otaku, Mikari decides to join the club and become a cosplayer herself, all to finally have a chance at winning Masamune's heart. However, Masamune's love for fictional characters may not be capable of extending to those who impersonate them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
