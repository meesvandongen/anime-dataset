  "synopsis": "Haru Yamato was never interested in futsal ever since the sport gained international fame 10 years ago. However, a chance to watch Japanese futsal player Tokinari Tennoji compete at the U-18 World Cup completely changed his perspective. When given the opportunity on his first day at Koyo Gakuen High School, Haru enthusiastically joins the futsal club.\n\nThere, he meets a variety of talented players including captain Toi Tsukioka, who was a part of the same U-18 team as Tennoji. Despite having a dynamic roster, the Koyo Futsal Club has a long way ahead when it comes to assembling a team that can stand up to powerhouse opponents—especially for Haru, who is a total beginner to the sport!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
