  "synopsis": "In an attempt to rescue Bellri and the others, Dellensen launches an attack on the pirate corps' Megafauna. Bellri, forced into space combat in Earth orbit, fails to realize he is facing his former instructor and shoots him down with the G-Self.\n\nMeanwhile, the Capital Army demands the return of the G-Self and Raraiya Monday, and deploys first the Mask team's Elf Bullocks and then Becker's Wuxia team. Behind the scenes, a crisis is developing which will drive them all to violate the taboos of SU-Cordism–the existence of a threat from space.\n\n(Source: AllTheAnime)",
