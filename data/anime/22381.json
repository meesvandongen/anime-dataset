  "synopsis": "Velonica has crossed the entire galaxy from the distant planet of Metrotopia and landed on Earth. Her mission is simple: to meet with Earth's leader and complete a contract that will allow them to install a giant antenna and connect Earth to the Galaxy Network.\n\nSoon upon her arrival, Velonica discovers that Earth does not have a single leader, and its inhabitants are preoccupied with strange, illogical activities. But before her father—the President of the Galaxy Network—intervenes, Velonica must find a way to make sense of this backwater planet.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
