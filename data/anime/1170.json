  "synopsis": "In these three self-contained half-hour stories, Lina Inverse and her partner, Naga The Serpent, take on a variety of jobs for quick cash, food, and/or their own skins. The first episode, \"The Scary Chimera Plan,\" pits them against a lunatic magician who intends to use Lina to create a fearsome, spell-slinging monster. Then, in \"Jeffry's Knighthood,\" they're hired by an overprotective mother to see that her son - a young man barely capable of holding a sword - becomes a respected knight, by \"helping\" him fight off the marauding soldiers terrorizing the area. Finally, \"Mirror, Mirror\" puts the two in a race to hunt down and capture (for bounty, of course) a rogue sorceror who's found an ancient artifact that can create loyal duplicates of anything or anyone, including his enemies. \n\n(Source: ANN)",
