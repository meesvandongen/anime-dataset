  "synopsis": "A new tournament, Squad Jam 3, has been announced in the popular VR game Gun Gale Online. This time, Pitohui, one of the best performers in the previous competition, offers to team up with Karen Kohiruimaki, better known in-game as LLENN, the \"Pink Devil.\" Despite her initial reluctance, Karen agrees to join Pitohui's team, LPFM, since she looks forward to facing SHINC, her rivals from the previous Squad Jam.\n\nThe newly formed LPFM enrolls in the tournament and is quickly recognized as the favorite to win due to the caliber of its players. As they strive to come out on top and win Squad Jam 3, LLENN, Pitohui, and the other members of LPFM battle against other competitors and tackle unexpected challenges.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
