  "synopsis": "A Hello Kitty claymation series.\n\nThe Stump Village itself is a group of tree stump houses located in a secluded area of a forest. The village residents are a tight-knit bunch: Badtz Maru, Cinnamoroll, My Melody, Pom Pom Purin, and Hello Kitty. The remaining Sanrio characters (of which there are literally hundreds) do not appear very much in this particular series. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",
