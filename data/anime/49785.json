  "synopsis": "For over one hundred years, a special quest has been waiting for a wizard skilled enough to complete it. On the northern continent of Guiltina, there are five immensely powerful Dragon Gods who possess great destructive force that can only be quelled by sealing them away. Natsu Dragneel and his friends from the Fairy Tail guild—Lucy Heartfilia, Gray Fullbuster, Erza Scarlet, Wendy Marvell, and the exceeds Happy and Charlés—consider this the perfect challenge to take on.\n\nThe Fairy Tail mages are not the only ones searching for the Dragon Gods. Diabolos, a guild exclusive for \"Dragon Eaters,\" seeks to enhance their Dragon Slayer magic by devouring the dragons. Meanwhile, Fairy Tail's newest addition, Touka, appears to be hiding something sinister from her new companions—and her secrets may bring disaster to the guild while its strongest wizards are away.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
