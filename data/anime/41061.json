After asking her father about it, she learns that the vehicle is a temporary loaner while her moped undergoes its annual maintenance.  \n\nWith arrangements to go camping at Yatsugatake the next day, Rin has no choice but to utilize the three-wheeler. As she embarks on her trip, Rin's traveling experience soon shifts gears, and she discovers a refined driving performance on new unexplored roads.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
