  "synopsis": "Qin Feng, a young man hailed as a once-in-a-millennium genius of the Wuji Kingdom, suffered the humiliation of his entire family being framed and wiped out, leaving him the sole survivor. After his martial meridians were destroyed, he was abandoned in a small, marginalized sect to fend for himself. Driven by a desire for power and revenge, he endured much hardship and bullying, with only his kind-hearted second senior sister, sharing his fate, offering him protection. Unbeknownst to everyone, Qin Feng had already secretly embarked on a difficult path of physical cultivation. \n\nUpon learning that three members of his sect could study at the Heavenly Dao Academy, and with the spots already secured, he no longer tolerated his fate. When humiliated again by the sect's genius, Yun Tianyu, he unleashed his physical cultivation identity, brutally beating Yun Tianyu and shocking everyone. He then took the initiative, repeatedly teaching Yun Tianyu a lesson and openly challenging the protective First Elder, vowing to secure a spot at the Heavenly Dao Academy, for only through this could he become stronger. To prevent his disciple from being further humiliated, they agreed to a contest in seven days, the winner of which would receive the spot to study at the Heavenly Dao Academy. During this process, Yun Tianyu broke through his cultivation level and unexpectedly became a Holy Son, becoming the object of everyone's admiration. Everyone thought he would win easily. Even his second senior sister advised him to give up and offered to give him her own spot, but Qin Feng refused. In just a few days, Qin Feng also received the Holy Man's inheritance. While shouldering the responsibility of saving humanity, he began to secretly undergo hellish cultivation.\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",
