  "synopsis": "Qingchen's parents divorced when he was young. In order not to cause trouble to his mother, he voluntarily lived with his gambling-addicted father. One day, with the appearance of a mysterious countdown on his arm, Qingchen's life changed. It connected two completely different worlds, and the moment the countdown reached zero, time stopped and space shattered. Qingchen traveled through time and space to the dangerous Prison No. 18 in the other world. Under the dense steel sky, he relied on courage and wisdom to forge ahead, overcame many tests, and was appreciated by the demigod Li Shutong. In the end, Qingchen was able to worship Li Shutong as his master, and Li Shutong will take Qingchen on the longest road among all the shortcuts in this world.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, Google translated)",
