  "synopsis": "2017 April Fools' Day event which is based on the world of the games made by Nitro+Chiral, and depicts the “love and life” of over 60 characters. Videos available include the opening movie, Chapter 27 [Sweet Pool and Lamento: Beyond the Void], Chapter 28 [Sweet Pool and Togainu no Chi], Chapter 29 [DRAMAtical Murder], and Chapter 30 [DRAMAtical Murder].\n\nComedic effect is enhanced when Nitro+'s style isn't used but rather the style of Plus Heads who is known for their absurdist gag comedy.\n\n(Source: Gematsu)",
