  "synopsis": "Aiwa is a hormonal young man who just wants to have a girlfriend and get laid. Perpetually daydreaming about his pretty schoolmate Kozue, Aiwa wastes no time in trying to win her affection. But one day, a mysterious package arrives at Aiwa's doorstep. It seems Aiwa is finally getting his mail order from some months ago—a cute android girl who's supposed to do whatever he asks! Now this will definitely mess up his plans for Kozue, but then having his very own cutie at home sure is convenient... what's a guy to do then?\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
