Though directionless, she speeds ahead at full throttle to achieve her dream of becoming a famous voice actress. However, when mysterious aliens come to Earth and upend Poemi's life, she must utilize every ounce of her power—including magic which she gains from a magic fish—if she wants to save the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
