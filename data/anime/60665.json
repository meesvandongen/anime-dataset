  "synopsis": "Gen Kinokura is a solitary camper looking for time away from the crowded city to refresh his mind and enjoy nature. But one day, Gen meets Shizuku Kusano at the supposedly empty campsite. A complete beginner at camping, Shizuku tries to settle in with Gen despite his protests. Gen reluctantly gives in once he notices her lackluster preparation.\n\nOffering advice for her next trip, Gen believes their interaction ends on this occasion. However, Shizuku decides to join his future solo outings to learn more about camping. Although no longer on their own, the two set rules on how to camp together, allowing them a give-and-take experience while still relishing the atmosphere in a form of solitude.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
