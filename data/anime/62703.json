  "synopsis": "To resurrect his beloved Ning Yudie, Luo Zheng embarks on a heaven-defying path unlike any before. At the Tianyu Realm, he turns against Tianqiong, yet beneath the Shenqi Tower, they fight together. Through blurred lines of love and hatred, and trials that temper flesh and bone, he forges his path to divinity. Now, having ascended to the superior realm, Luo Zheng is determined to break the chains of fate and become the one truly free from destiny's grasp... But a deadly threat that exists beyond even heaven's will is now closing in.\n\n(Source: Youku)",
