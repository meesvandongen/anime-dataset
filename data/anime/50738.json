  "synopsis": "Three hundred years ago, the newly reincarnated Azusa Aizawa had resolved to live a slow life forever. At that point, she would have never even thought of reaching level 99 through only killing slimes, let alone becoming the strongest being in the continent. Nevertheless, it is due to her strength and kindness that many girls from different backgrounds—including the dragon Laika, the elf Halkara, the demon queen Pecora, and even the anthropomorphized slime girls Falfa and Shalsha—are all drawn to her. With her ever-growing circle of companions, Azusa's laid-back adventures are far from over—and with even more girls appearing on her doorstep, her already enjoyable life is slated to become even livelier!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
