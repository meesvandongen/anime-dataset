  "synopsis": "The story takes place, ostensibly, in an imaginary modern-day country. The \"Good for You\" political party that rose to power without electoral consent has instituted a \"Chocolate Prohibition Law!\" All food and drink that involves chocolate, along with nearly every other enjoyable treat has been outlawed by the new administration.\n\nEnter Huntly and Smudger, two young boys who used to hang around Ms. Bubby's sweets store just to catch a glimpse of the lovely Louise. Since the new law was passed, the store, once a lively place, had become destitute. Louise tips off the boys to a fledgling business involving the distribution of bootlegged chocolate. As they make their way to the secret mine of chocolate ingredients, they come across a mysterious code.\n\nAfter successfully decoding the cipher, the boys enter the illegal dealer's headquarters. Inside, they are pleasantly surprised by the commencement of a Chocolate Party! Hunter and Smudger are blissfully reunited with the taste of chocolate again. But the party is abruptly cut short by the presence of the Chocolate Police. As people flee in all directions the boys' friend Div is captured by the officials!\n\nUnforgivable! All he wanted was a bite of chocolate! What is so wrong about that? Huntley, Smudger, and Louise decide to embark on their own chocolate bootlegging venture. With their combined talents, knowledge and passion, will they be able to reclaim the \"Fun and Beautiful\" world they once inhabited?!\n\n(Source: Eleven Arts)",
