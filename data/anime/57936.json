One day, suddenly, Sasha, the princess of a mysterious country called Al-Fazhar and a cinnamon-skinned heroine, appears. She brings with her a letter from her father, which surprisingly reveals that Sasha has become Takayuki’s wife. Without wasting time, Sasha bewilders Takayuki by seeking the consummation of their marriage to conceive an heir and fulfill her marital duties.\n\n(Source: TMDB)",
