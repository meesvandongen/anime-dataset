  "synopsis": "Belle Lablac, the only human in an anthropomorphic animal world, is recovering from the wounds she suffered after a violent falling-out with her companion, Adonis Question. Despite feeling guilty and betrayed, Belle reaffirms her resolve to set out on a journey to discover her roots—even without him.\n\nWhen Belle reunites with the comrades she fought alongside in the Catacombs, one of them—Guinness—publicly questions the circumstances surrounding the battle. He challenges the foundational laws of Schubertland, where the forces of good are expected to sacrifice their lives in the never-ending struggle against evil. Belle offers to support Guinness' petition to King Rawhide to declare the Catacombs neutral ground.\n\nMeanwhile, Adonis aligns himself with the forces of darkness. He reappears in Schubertland and targets King Rawhide, threatening to plunge the land into chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
