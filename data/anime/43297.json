  "synopsis": "In the late 19th century, the Robin Hood-like thief March kept Scotland Yard busy by robbing the rich to help the poor, but Sherlock Holmes captured him at his illegitimate daughter Kitty's birthday party. Four years later, March attacked Scarface, the prison's chief thief, and escaped by scaling the wall. Holmes, knowing March had ulterior motives, allowed him to fulfill his wish before taking him to surrender. But Scarface suddenly reappeared, pointing his sword at Kitty. \n\nHolmes and Watson, to save the innocent, joined forces with the twin detectives, Lee the Gorilla and Foxy, to rescue her. A life-or-death battle unfolded amidst a sky full of fireworks… The popular Sherlock Holmes book series is brought to the big screen for the first time, combining knowledge and entertainment—a must-see for adults and children alike!\n\n(Source: Douban, translated)",
