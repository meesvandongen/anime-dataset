  "synopsis": "Aspiring Orange Company Undine Anya Dostoyevskaya feels dejected upon learning that her gondolier mentor, Alice Carroll, is not spending much time with her own mentor, Athena Glory. Athena—the Undine-turned-opera singer—has been attempting to arrange a meeting with Alice, but the latter seems to be avoiding her for unknown reasons.\n\nTo try and resolve this predicament, Anya calls upon her fellow Undines Ai Aino and Azusa B. McLaren. As the trio works to bring Alice and Athena together, Anya gains a deeper insight into her seniors' feelings, which might just be the key to untangling the uncertainties between them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
