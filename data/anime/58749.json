  "synopsis": "With the threat of Ursus and Reunion doubling down upon Lungmen, Ch'en, once the city's fiercest defender, renounces her loyalties before Lungmen's Chief Executive Wei Yenwu, revealing herself as Infected and the sister of Talulah, Reunion's enigmatic leader. Cast adrift from Lungmen with an arrest warrant, Ch'en sets out to confront Reunion, convinced that she alone can deliver the reckoning her sister deserves. As Rhodes Island intervenes to prevent total annihilation, Doctor, Amiya, Kal'tsit, and the rest of the team hope to navigate a conflict where the faintest spark of justice may at last ignite Lungmen's rise from its embers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
