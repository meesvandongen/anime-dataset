  "synopsis": "The rivalry between three piano geniuses in Towa Hall starts with the prodigy Kousei Arima. While his emotive first performance enamors the free-spirited Emi Igawa, Kousei eventually evolves his technique to become exact and precise, finding himself a new follower in the eccentric Takeshi Aiza. Unbeknownst to outsiders, the two other players begin to target Kousei with their respective performances. Emi attempts to convert Kousei back to his old self with her vibrant playing, while Aiza turns his admiration for Kousei into motivation to beat him at his own game.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
