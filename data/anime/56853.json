  "synopsis": "In Cinnamoroll's origin story, a white dog flew down from the skies one day and was discovered by a female Cafe Cinnamon worker. The \"I.Cinnamoroll\" brand depicts an alternate world that poses a what-if question: What if Cinnamoroll had not met the Cafe Cinnamon worker on that fateful day? The \"I\" in the title stands for both the English first-person pronoun \"I\" and the Japanese word \"ai\" (love), and it represents the brand's theme of taking care of one's own body and mind. \n\n(Source: ANN)",
