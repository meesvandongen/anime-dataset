  "synopsis": "Madara, nicknamed \"Nyanko-sensei,\" runs into two young children when he gets separated from his temporary owner Takashi Natsume. Unequipped to handle kids, Nyanko-sensei tries to wriggle his way out; but fearing for their safety around the ravenous forest youkai, he decides to escort the siblings to safety. However, even for an all-powerful youkai such as Nyanko-sensei, dealing with the playful and overly curious nature of children can prove to be an exhausting challenge.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
