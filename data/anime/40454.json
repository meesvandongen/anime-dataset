Despite its preceding reputation, the supposed bloodthirsty creature happens to be crying and flees from a group of adventurers. The monster, taking the form of a terrified little girl, prompts Bell to swiftly decide to hide her. Unbeknownst to him, this act of kindness will cause massive repercussions that will soon echo throughout the entire city of Orario.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
