  "synopsis": "The horse girls of Uma Musume: Pretty Derby return in a series of bite-sized shorts filled with gags, parodies, and everyday chaos. Instead of the high-stakes drama of the racetrack, Umayuru focuses on their lighthearted daily lives, showcasing each character's quirks through quick comedy skits and playful interactions. Released on the franchise’s official YouTube channel, this mini-anime delivers a fun, casual dose of Uma Musume charm in just a few minutes per episode.",
