  "synopsis": "Meet mysterious Miharu, awesome Aya, ruthless Ryoko, mind-blowing Misty, youthful Yukari and heavenly Hikary in a stunning series of computer-generated femininity.\n\nIn Super Sonic Jet Girl, you'll enter a hellish nightclub where lingerie-clad Miharu defends herself in a most personal fashion. Chat places the longingly lovely Aya on the streets of your dreams. In Run & Run, Yukari breathes hard and races fast - to nowhere. A Jellyfish Day finds the blonde bombshell Hikary starring in a music video about her private passions. Ryoko inhabits Yamag's Garage, an arena of \"Pure Mind,\" \"Love,\" and a very \"Beautiful Face.\" And Misty mesmerizes in a music video in which she brags: \"I'm your magnet of love, and I'm here to serve you.\" \n\n(Source: AniDB)",
