  "synopsis": "After years of conflict, humans and monsters have settled their differences and are now at peace. This post-war era led to the foundation of Lindworm—a town which has since become the focal point of racial harmony.\n\nAs a human doctor specializing in monster biology, Glenn Litbeit runs a small clinic alongside his partner, Saphentite Neikes, who is a half-snake monster known as a lamia. He uses his knowledge to tend to any monsters who seek his aid. Whatever affliction, concern, or injury it may be, he will always be there, ready to help.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
