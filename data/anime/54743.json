  "synopsis": "Polka Shinoyama's life takes a dramatic turn after being forced to use his magical powers in public. His divination cabinet attracts the attention of several people hellbent on exposing his true nature as the reincarnation of Corpse God, a necromancer from the Other World. To make matters worse, Polka and his friends are framed for the murder of one of their protector's employees.\n\nWhen group member Takumi Kuruya is abducted by his former boss, Kuon Higuro, Polka sends his most trustworthy ally Misaki Sakimiya to their friend's rescue. It turns out that some of the recent incidents the group finds themselves caught up in are interconnected, and Polka needs to be twice as careful if he wants to make it out alive from this maze of pitfalls.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
