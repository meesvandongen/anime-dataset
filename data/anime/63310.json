Unbeknownst to him, this apartment complex houses quite a few women with very... unusual sexual preferences. This becomes a problem when a mysterious entity begins giving \"Libido Cloth\" to these women—skimpy outfits that give them superpowers and cause them to go on lewd rampages! Will Yoshida be able to stop them?\n\n(Source: MU)",
