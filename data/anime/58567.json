  "synopsis": "Sung Jin-Woo, dubbed the weakest hunter of all mankind, grows stronger by the day with the supernatural powers he has gained. However, keeping his skills hidden becomes more difficult as dungeon-related incidents pile up around him.\n\nWhen Jin-Woo and a few other low-ranked hunters are the only survivors of a dungeon that turns out to be a bigger challenge than initially expected, he draws attention once again, and hunter guilds take an increased interest in him. Meanwhile, a strange hunter who has been lost for ten years returns with a dire warning about an upcoming catastrophic event. As the calamity looms closer, Jin-Woo must continue leveling up to make sure nothing stops him from reaching his ultimate goal—saving the life of his mother.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
