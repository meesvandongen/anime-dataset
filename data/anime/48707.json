  "synopsis": "Once a terrifying yakuza, \"Immortal Dragon\" Tatsu now continues to conquer the challenges of mundane life. While his beloved wife Miku works, Tatsu equips his trusted apron, takes care of their finances, hunts down the biggest store sales, and learns the way of a true househusband with the help of the neighborhood wives. Although Tatsu abandoned the life of violence, his former colleagues and enemies reappear around every corner—but this time only as rivals in homemaking ventures. Surrounded by a myriad of chores to occupy him, it seems that no matter how tough things get, Tatsu's undying perseverance prevails as he gives his tasks his absolute best.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
