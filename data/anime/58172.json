  "synopsis": "The golden age has dawned for treasure hunters, who raid treasure vaults all over the world in search of glory, despite the dangers. Immeasurable wealth, fame, and power await those who prevail.\n\n\"Let's be treasure hunters!\"\n\nThis promise between Krai Andrey and his friends came to a sad conclusion when young Krai realized he didn't have a treasure-hunting bone in his body. Yet for some reason, people's expectations of Krai continued to grow—as did the danger to his life. While his friends became greater, greedier beasts, Krai mastered the art of begging and pleading!\n\nWitness the weal and woe of a man who just wants to retire. \n\n(Source: Sol Press)",
