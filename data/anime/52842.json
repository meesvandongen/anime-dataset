  "synopsis": "Behind the Schoolbag is a story about self-salvation. Having suffered from a miserable childhood, Shaun couldn't help but question his own value. Human relationship has always been Shaun's barrier, sometimes, he wishes he could stay alone, but in reality, Shaun has to re-enter the society. Staying in his own comfort zone, Shaun can do nothing but lock up his heart and distant himself from others.\n\nAll the stress and pressure in modern life is driving people insane. We have to learn how to sooth our own emotions so as to survive. We can do nothing but meditate and reflect upon ourselves. We can observe the truth and the essence wisely and feel the presence of now and start living.\n\n(Source: Vimeo)",
