  "synopsis": "The Maine Coon is one of the largest domesticated cat breeds, standing out among other cats for its impressive size and intelligence. But regular salarywoman Saku Fukuzawa has a hard time explaining why her rescued black cat now towers over her. Yukichi is no run-of-the-mill cat; he is a masterful feline who has taken charge of the chores in the Fukuzawa household. While his master rushes to catch the train during the morning rush hour and works late into the night, the giant cat is diligently packing Saku's lunch, cooking her meals, cleaning their home, and buying groceries.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
