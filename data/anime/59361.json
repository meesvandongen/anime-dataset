  "synopsis": "Coworkers Yui Mitsuya and Masugu Tateishi are the last people anyone would expect to get along—especially with their constant office quarrels. However, looks can be deceiving: they are actually dating! Afraid to lose the peace of their professional lives, Yui and Masugu play up their discord even more to ensure nobody discovers their secret.\n\nAs awkward situations and close calls pile up, the risk of Yui and Masugu's coworkers catching on increases. Keeping up the pretense is not easy, but with each new day, their relationship only grows stronger.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
