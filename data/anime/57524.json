  "synopsis": "\"Huh? Who are you calling loser?\"\n\nAs the background of the class, I, Kazuhiko Nukumizu, witnessed a popular girl—Anna Yanami—getting rejected by another guy.\n\n\"Even though he said we'll get married. Don't you think he's pretty mean?\"\n\"When did he say that?\"\n\"When we were 4 or 5 years old.\"\n\nThat doesn't count, right? With this, the losing heroines like Remon Yakishio from the track and field club and Chika Komari from the literature club.\n\n\"Nukumizu-kun. There are two types of girls: childhood friends or cheating cats.\"\n\"I see. Well, that's a bold statement.\"\n\nThere's a fortune for those who shine only after losing. Losing heroines—the curtain to the mysterious coming-of-age story Makeine opens now!\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)",
