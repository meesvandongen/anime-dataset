  "synopsis": "The suddenly awakening ghost power leads to a conflict between Alois and the five ghosts that have been lingering in Agate's house. It turns out that these ghosts were all Agate's friends before death. The two sides have a negotiation at Agate's family graveyard. Alois wants all ghosts to go to the Hell Valley for reincarnation, but all ghosts want to find out the cause of Agate's suffering. In order not to hurt Agate any more, all ghosts decide to leave. They share their memories with Alois before leaving, hoping that he could find some clues. After seeing the memories of a woman called A Zhu, another child called Lv collapses, and Alois feels very weak and also the urgency.\n\n(Source: Bilibili Youtube)",
