Living with his parents in a small town where humans and robots coexist, he has many friends thanks to his cheerful nature. Eager to learn and try new things, Astro and his companions often embark on exciting adventures. But their explorations are met with unexpected troubles when the wicked criminal Hamegg—joined by his accomplices Gora, a pink gorilla robot, and Professor Flau—interferes with their endeavors. \n\nAs the little robot boy and his group bravely face challenges, their efforts become part of a journey to discover the world's values and wonders.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
