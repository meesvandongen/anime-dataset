  "synopsis": "Extra Blu-ray/DVD Episode 13 included on vol. 7.\n\nIn this special episode, Kakeru and the team enter a \"Pink Night\" instead of red. The \"Black Knights\" are now \"Pink Ero-Rangers,\" and Lisolette is a bondage driver. The team's powers are also warped with an erotic twist. Kakeru can see through clothes; Yuka can change the boys into girls; Misuzu's swords are vibrators; Kukuri can speak, but only says and draws profanities; Yukiko becomes sexually excited when she takes off her glasses; and Takahisa shoots a small spout of water from his finger. This episode is merely a parody and is in no way related to the original storyline.",
