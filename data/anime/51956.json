  "synopsis": "In a future where hip-hop reigns supreme, skilled rappers put on shows known as Phantom Lives. There they turn their powerful emotions into captivating illusions for their audiences through the usage of \"Phantometal\"—a material that reacts to the rapper's DNA to create the fantastic imagery. However, usage of Phantometal causes rappers to relive past traumas and painful memories in so-called Trap Reactions. Depending on the strength of the rapper's emotions, these reactions can be debilitating and even affect their psyche.\n\nAfter disappearing without a trace 10 years prior, the legendary CLUB Paradox mysteriously returns to announce the start of a new Phantom Live competition called Paradox Live. With 10 billion yen on the line, four established groups—BAE, The Cat's Whiskers, cozmez, and Akanyatsura—are invited to take center stage. Though wary of the strange circumstances, each of these groups have their own reasons for throwing themselves into the competition. Unfortunately, the path to glory may be more ruthless than they could imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
