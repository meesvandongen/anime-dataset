  "synopsis": "A boy and his young sister were curious about the book someone had left on a bench, and they opened the book. Then the small Tower of Bavel was completed on a page. Looking into the tower, they found an old man sitting and reading a book, surrounded by innumerable books. As the man turned pages, mythical animals appeared and disappeared.\n\n(Source: yamamura-animation.jp)",
