However, her life crumbles on her 17th birthday when Faust delivers the worst news possible: Meg has one year left to live. Due to a congenital curse, after turning 18, she will age a thousand times faster than normal and then die in mere days.\n\nFaust tells Meg there is a way to cure her affliction: she needs to consume a seed of life. In order to create the seed, Meg must collect a thousand tears of joy within 12 months. Although she is distraught by the difficulty of the task at hand, Meg nonetheless embarks on the journey to prolong her life, meeting countless people with their own stories to tell.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
