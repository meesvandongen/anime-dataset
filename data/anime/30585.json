  "synopsis": "On the eve of a junior high school's cultural festival, Typhoon No. 8 slowly approaches the isolated Okinawan town of Naha. A mysterious girl wearing a strange necklace suddenly appears alongside the storm, catching Shuuichi Azuma off guard. \n\nAfter getting into a fight with his best friend Kenta Saijou over his decision to quit the baseball team, Azuma notices the same girl standing atop an electrical tower when lightning strikes, cutting power to the school and causing her to tumble down below. Unwilling to stay in the same room as Saijou, Azuma runs off to rescue the strange girl as the storm intensifies.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
