  "synopsis": "Exhausted by your daily life, you were seeking a way to heal. You wanted to be kindly praised and comforted. \"Toddlers can be legally fawned over, they're so lucky...\" Such thoughts were an escape from reality.\n\nOne day, you bought a blue pacifier from a general store. When you popped it into your mouth, you were engulfed by a mysterious light. Before you knew it, you were reincarnated in another world as a five-year-old child!\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
