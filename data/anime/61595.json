  "synopsis": "Nan-young is a scientist whose astronaut mom failed to return to Earth when things went awry during her Mars probe. Nan-young has always dreamed of exploring space too and longs to go to Mars in hopes of finding a trace of her mom.\n\nHer dream comes true when she is selected as one of the astronauts for a Mars probe project. Before she blasts off though, she meets Jay, a musician who also fixes retro sound instruments. It's all thanks to an old turntable that Nan-young inherited from her mom.\n\n(Source: Netflix, edited)",
