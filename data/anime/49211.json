  "synopsis": "After intense fighting, the Gunpla Battle U.S. Championship enters its final round. Here, the figure of a certain fighter appears.\n\nA few months later Misa Satsukino, building a new Gunpla in the Ayato Shopping Street, seems to be in a worse mood than usual. As an outlet for her unfocused anger, she sets her completed Gunpla in a simulator and enters battle, but the Gunpla is suddenly restrained.\n\nOn the eve of the huge GB Festa event, the fates of the Gunpla Fighters are at a critical juncture.\n\n(Source: Gundam.info)",
