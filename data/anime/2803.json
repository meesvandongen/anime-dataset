If several Release Points, where the Planet Energy concentrated, were attacked at once, the Earth would explode.\nWhen the first attack was made, Takasugi Seiji escaped into an old temple with his girl friend Kosaka Hikaru. Then, he received, Orin, a token of the leader of the Earth guardians, from the conscience of the Earth. By the power of Orin, the patrol car was turned into a Robot, Da Garn. \n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",
