  "synopsis": "Akio Honjou is a high school student with a special gift for music. He can perfectly recall any piece of music that he has heard only once. One day, as he tries to reproduce a particularly soothing piano melody, he unexpectedly meets Juri Makina—the girl whose cell phone had spontaneously played the tune earlier in class.\n\nIf art is the only way to truly know what landscapes populate others' inner worlds, then can this particular tune pave the way for Akio to begin to understand the more intellectual and emotional aspects of his captivating classmate, Juri?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
