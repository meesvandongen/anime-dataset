  "synopsis": "Living in an animation studio fawned over by its staff, Baja and his best friend Ga-chan have all sorts of fun every day. While working on a particularly stressful project, the studio's head director, Kanako, wishes that she could take a trip to the sea. This makes Baja wonder what sort of place the sea might be and if he and Ga-chan could use magic to experience it as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
