  "synopsis": "After fleeing from Rumble Town, Seth, Doc and Melie are back at the Artemis Institute. Thanks to Alma, Seth learns more about Piodon, his mysterious brother. But the quest for the Nemeses mythical nest Radiant has already waited too long, so the Horned Boy and his friends head to the island-continent of the Wizard Knights.\n\nThis location may be a new city for audiences, but it's a decaying world that's falling apart! Not only must Seth deal with these hardships, but he must also face a personal phenomenon where visions are invading his mind a little more each day.\n\n(Source: monstersandcritics)",
