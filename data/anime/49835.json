As a researcher at the Japanese Institute of Virtual Science, Koyomi's father is involved in the investigation of the phenomenon of parallel worlds. Through his father's job, the young boy meets Shiori Satou, the daughter of another divorced researcher. Soon becoming friends, the two spend much of their childhood together.\n\nAs Koyomi and Shiori grow closer together over the years, the two intend to marry in the future.
