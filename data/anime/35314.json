  "synopsis": "After the fierce battle with Kirukiru Amou, the school's strongest students, the Supreme Five Swords, are prepared to take the blame for the conflict. To their surprise, instead of condemning anyone, the principal abruptly assigns the group to a recreational trip to a hot spring! Moreover, they are allowed to take the infamous transfer student Fudou Nomura with them—so long as he passes his supplementary exams first. With the girls of the Swords helping him, Fudou must earn the right to unwind from his busy school life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
