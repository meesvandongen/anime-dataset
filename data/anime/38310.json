  "synopsis": "A music video about a cat named Yume (which also means \"dream\" in Japanese). The song itself parodies the songs Der Flohwalzer (in Japan named as Neko Fun Jatta / I Stepped on a Cat) and Beautiful Dreamer (Yumemiru Hito) depending on whether or not \"Yume\" is being seen as a real cat or as a metaphorical dream or as a dream Yume the cat is having.\n\nThe music video was aired for 1 month before becoming lost media. In 2016 the Minna no Uta Hakkutsu Project (Minna no Uta Excavation Project) was able to find discover a copy and the music video was saved and re-aired once again after 34 years.",
