  "synopsis": "A newly appointed guidance counselor, Toshikazu Fujimi, can use hypnotic drugs that allow him to modify the will of any targeted female—he can bring out any hidden feeling from their minds and use it to his advantage. He attacks many of the students that came for counseling and not just them, but those are all just preparations for something much bigger.\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)",
