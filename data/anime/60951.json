  "synopsis": "Hero Toto possesses great skills, but his extreme shyness has left him unable to form a party, causing him to remain stuck in the town where his journey began.\n\nOne day, he is suddenly invited to join a party by three beautiful women—Ciel, Anemone, and Goa. Overjoyed at finally setting off on an adventure, Toto is filled with excitement... but little does he know, these women are dead set on killing him!\n\nA deathly harem romcom unfolds as the socially anxious hero, who faints from mere flustered excitement around women, finds himself the target of three deadly companions, each with their own reasons for wanting him gone!\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
