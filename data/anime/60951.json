  "synopsis": "Toto has been dreaming about adventuring with other people for as long as he can remember. Despite his hero title, he still remains without allies due to his timid personality. Therefore, when three women: Ciel, Anemone, and Goa suddenly request to join him, Toto is overjoyed. Unbeknownst to him, they are all assassins assigned to eliminate him!\n\nWhile Toto resolves to protect his would-be killers, the women fight over who can finish off the hero. As Toto remains oblivious of his new party members' true intentions and finds himself passing out every time he gets flustered, the four of them embark on their peculiar adventure into the greater world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
