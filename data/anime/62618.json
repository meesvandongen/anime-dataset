  "synopsis": "Fifteen years ago, Luofeng City was struck by a bizarre catastrophe, becoming a dead and silent ruin overnight. The young Ding Xiao, born at the age of seven, was granted a place in the Town Spirit Division. However, he destroyed his own spirit and became a coffin carrier for the Gui Tribe. For five years, he experienced the vicissitudes of life. Unexpectedly, he awakened his physiognomy in the face of adversity, excelled in the promotion assessment, and became a feared figure in the Spirit Division. Now, evil spirits are rising in all directions, and strange events are endless. To cure his sister Ding Ling's increasingly strange illness, Ding Xiao resolutely restarts his spiritual awakening journey, only to be drawn into an unfathomable vortex of political intrigue. The hidden truth of Luofeng City gradually unfolds, and behind all this, the fate of Ding Ling is inextricably intertwined...\n\n(Source: Youku, translated)",
