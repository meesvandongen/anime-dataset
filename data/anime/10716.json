  "synopsis": "With the safety of Fantasium Gardens compromised and Quon Mitsuchi missing, the future of the Attractors has never been more uncertain. As they desperately flee from members of Custos, they wonder what lies ahead and whether the sacrifices they had made to get this far were even worth it. Meanwhile, the revelation that the Tears of Time are hidden under Fantasium Gardens changes everyone's understanding of the status quo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
