  "synopsis": "There's a new teacher in town—Spelunker! This unusual man is anything but a typical instructor, giving speeches about traffic safety to the students, reacting strangely to a humidifier, and enjoying lunch— albeit with ample condiment mishaps. With such a bizarre new role model to learn from, Spelunker's students will never be the same!\n\n(Source: Anime-Planet)",
