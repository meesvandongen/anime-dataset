  "synopsis": "In a post-apocalyptic future, a police raid devastates the imposing headquarters of a religious cult. Upon evaluating the casualties, two officers discover a winged girl lying unconscious in chains and attempt to resuscitate her. However, she barely awakens before a group of specialists wearing protective suits hastily takes her away.\n\nDisappointed to see the angel-like being end up in confinement again, the policemen resolve to set her free and start making the necessary preparations. Despite the need to infiltrate a restricted research facility, there is no stopping the duo from readily throwing themselves into a deadly rescue mission.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
