  "synopsis": "This is the story of a friendship between a boy named Taro and the mysterious Wonder-kun, using \"the first dream of the New Year\" as a motif. Guided by Wonder-kun, Taro departs on a space trip searching for adventure.\n\nThis work combines live-action and animation and was broadcast by NHK for kids staying at home watching TV over the New Year holidays. The program was 20 minutes long but the story portion was roughly 11 minutes, as such MAL will reflect the duration of the anime itself rather than the program it was shown in.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",
