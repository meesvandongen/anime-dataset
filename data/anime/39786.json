  "synopsis": "With a track inspired by Tejime, a Japanese custom of ceremonial rhythmic hand clapping, HIFANA gives thanks and bids farewell to the Heisei era (1989-2019), a time when the transition from analog to digital gave rise to so many new and innovative means of expression. This is their first new song in 9 years.\n\n(Source: YouTube)",
