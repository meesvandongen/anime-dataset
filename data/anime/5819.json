He gets a feather, and if he always carries it, they will meet again. He returns to his home following the path, but the next day he cant find it again. Time progresses and he forgets the girl. 50 years later he returns to the same city and he dreams of the girl. He is still dutifully carrying the feather. \n\nWritten, drawn, and directed by famed illustrator Yoshitaka Amano. \n\n(Source: AniDB, ANN) ",
