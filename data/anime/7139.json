  "synopsis": "Due to a spacecraft failure, Ryu, a human astronaut, and the AI \"MOS\" are forced to crash-land on a mysterious planet called Gdleen. There, Ryu meets a cute Euradonian fairy named Fana. However, the planet is in the midst of a dispute over a supposedly magical temple. The self-proclaimed God Gavana captures Fana to use as a sacrifice, and it's up to Ryu to save her.\nWill they all be able to escape? And what is the true identity of the being calling itself Gavana?\n\n(Source: Translated from gdleen.hatsune.cc)",
