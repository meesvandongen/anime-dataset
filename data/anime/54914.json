There was also the famous robbery case one year ago, called the \"300 million Bikkuri-Man sticker case.\" One day, a high-school delivery part-timer named Yamato gets involved in a battle over stickers between two competing convenience stores. The Angel Mart owned by the Phoenix store manager is famous for its easy-to-use glitter stickers. The Devil Store across the street also tries to attract Bikkuri-Man fans to their store. Former comrades are divided into allies and foes, and the battle of destiny begins.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
