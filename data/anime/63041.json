The mission given to them by the king is to act as the “Magic Sabers,”\nhelping people in the human world.\n\nThey cannot return to the kingdom until they are recognized as fully-fledged magicians!? To use magic, all five must transform together, and what's more, when they de-transform, they end up naked!? The chaotic magical life of five boys.\n\n(Source: Official site, translated)",
