  "synopsis": "The cold air from the air circulation duct in the refrigerator turned the vegetables into animals: The pea pig brothers Dookong, Saekong, Naekong, mushroom-radish Hippo Doori, carrot-donkey Kaero, and cucumber-alligator Agle. They travel to Refrigerator Land (Cutie Land) through the air duct. They fall on egg-rabbit Aromi's flower garden! The animals help to fix and reorganize Aromi's flower garden which was damaged because of them.\n\nThey meet sausage-monkey Cocomong and set to learn about friendship, compassion, and responsibility together through playing.\n\n(Source: Official YouTube Channel)",
