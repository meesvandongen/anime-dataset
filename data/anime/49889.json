  "synopsis": "Despite a rough start, Makoto Misumi's life in another world takes a positive turn when he meets more demihumans who recognize his presence. Now as the leader of a fast-growing demihuman community, Makoto wishes to make human society more accepting of them and thus builds a business showcasing the demihumans' abilities. To extend his reach further, Makoto enrolls at the Rotsgard Academy to learn magic and expand his business venture there.\n\nMeanwhile, the goddess who summoned and forsaken Makoto had brought two other people to her world shortly after sending him away, making them heroes of their respective nations. Given enough time, Makoto's path will intertwine with both of these heroes, which may cause the world to take a drastic direction.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
