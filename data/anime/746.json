  "synopsis": "High-profile actor Kyousuke Munakata is known to the public as a charming playboy, but he harbors a scandalous secret: he is in a sexual relationship with his teenage son, Mira. Mira is head-over-heels for his papa, though he is pushed to his limit by the stress of maintaining his romantic secret while also balancing his first year of high school and Kyousuke's sexual appetite. With the stress building, along with paparazzi-fueled rumors of a wedding in Kyousuke's future, Mira must decide if his illicit romance is worth the cost of mental peace.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
