  "synopsis": "On his deathbed, Horus' father tells him that they are actually refugees from a village that was destroyed when the devil Grunwald tricked the villagers into turning against each other. This compels Horus to travel to his original homeland in hopes of finding other survivors. Before long, he settles in another village in the region and establishes a good reputation by defeating fierce animals that terrorize the villagers. Just when Horus seems to have achieved stability, however, Grunwald sets his sights on the village once more, sowing seeds of distrust among its inhabitants.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
