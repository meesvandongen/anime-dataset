  "synopsis": "This is the Animation Store Manager!!\n\nAnime Tenchou is a CM character for Animate, one of Japan's biggest retailer of anime, games, and manga. The character series was created by Shimamoto Kazuhiko for publicity purposes. Later adapted into a manga, a weekly radio drama and this OVA animated by GAINAX and directed by Anno Hideaki.\n\nAnizawa Meito is the blazing store manager. He is a fireball who loves animation merchandise at heart. He takes over the dying wish of the former store manager, though still alive, who was attacked by the rival store and becomes a \"store manager\" of newly opened animation goods specialty store, Animate. The scarlet, \"store manager visor\" is his trademark.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
