Unlike his looks, he is a warmhearted and a loving father.\nMrs. Fork makes cupcakes out of the most unusual ingredients that leaves you questioning whether it's edible, even for animals.\nChabby, the little brother, interacts very closely with animals and befriends them more than people.\n\nThe series depicts the daily lives of Tilly and her spooky family in a satirical tone that the viewers are sure to fall in love with.\n\n(Source: WelCon)",
