When he was in a desperate situation, he accidentally met a man who called himself \"Tapir\" and was sent into a fruit of the \"Yanfu Fruit Tree\". Li Yan must complete three tasks issued by the system within the time limit, and earn money through boxing matches in exchange for Yanfu points to buy medicine that can cure terminal illnesses. \n\nAs he gets to know Longyuan Fortress where he is located, Li Yan is gradually involved in the disputes in the fortress, and he also realizes that there are other Yanfu Walkers competing with him in secret. After overcoming many difficulties, Li Yan finally successfully completed the task and gained a new life.\n\n(Source: bilibili, translated)",
