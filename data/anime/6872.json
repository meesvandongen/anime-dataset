  "synopsis": "When Joe Shimamura gets in a serious car crash, strange men quickly load his body into a fake ambulance. He is transported to the headquarters of Black Ghost, an organization that promotes human conflicts in order to profit off of wars. It is here where Joe is reborn as the powerful Cyborg 009.\n\nUnwilling to serve as instruments of destruction, 009 and the other cyborgs revolt and escape so they can live their lives in peace. Black Ghost, however, is not willing to let the cyborgs they envisioned as their superweapons go without a fight.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
