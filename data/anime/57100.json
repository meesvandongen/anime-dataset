  "synopsis": "Trapped with thousands of people in The New Gate, a virtual reality game, the elite player Shinya Kiritani resolves to clear the game and finally return home. However, after he manages to single-handedly defeat the final boss, Shinya is transported to a new world—seemingly indistinguishable from the one he just escaped.\n\nShinya discovers that as long as the game menu and his skills are unchanged, he cannot leave this oddly familiar world. In his search of a way to break out from this new dimensional prison, Shinya encounters Tiera Lucent, a hotel receptionist who happens to be a protégée of Schnee Raizar—one of Shinya's former party members. With this glimmer of hope, Shinya strives to reunite with Schnee and find out the truth about The New Gate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
