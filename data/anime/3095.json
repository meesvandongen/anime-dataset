  "synopsis": "While on the job, it is important to watch how you present yourself as people's perceptions can mean everything. For Mai Waku, an owner of a firm tackling supernatural problems, this simple task can be incredibly difficult. With her unavoidable sex appeal, Mai seems to always find a way to end up naked while working on a case. Dealing with a variety of people from well-known celebrities to innkeepers, Mai cannot seem to avoid precarious situations where she lacks clothes in the presence of her clients.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
