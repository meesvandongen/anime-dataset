  "synopsis": "Protecting the earth and maintaining peace, Ultraman used to be a god-like existence for the Earth, but in recent decades, he disappeared into a mystery... The replacement for him was the elite team Dragon Force, part of the GSB Earth Security Organization. GSB has been receiving reports of global energy anomalies in the near future, and there have been huge disasters around the world. The GSB organization sent the Dragon Force to find out the causes of the energy anomalies, but unexpectedly found that the incident had a relationship with Ultraman... The unexpected encounters between the old and new generations of the Earth's guardians led to the hostile sides of life and death. In the end, is this an accident or a conspiracy, who saw the final truth? \n\n(Source: Ultraman Wiki)",
