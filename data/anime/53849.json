  "synopsis": "A flight to Antarctica turns into a frantic rescue mission after the plane mysteriously vanishes. Efforts to locate the missing passengers lead rescuers to discover the plane's course set for a never-before-seen mountain range - the largest on Earth.\n\nTowering over 10,000 feet above sea level, the Everest-eclipsing eighth wonder of the world draws attention from the world's best climbers and thrill-seekers. Although they have conquered the tallest peaks in the past, Earth's new vertigo-inducing heights are surpassed only by the dreadful horrors awaiting at the top.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
