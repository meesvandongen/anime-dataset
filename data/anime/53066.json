  "synopsis": "When I recalled my childhood, a magnet that accompanied me to grow up and a dead friend was the symbol of my past years. I tied the magnet to the trousers and pulled it out all day. The magnet could suck the iron on the road. Blocks or coins make me very happy. Until I met the friend who wanted to fly to the universe, he was as fat as I was, and then he accidentally fell into the water and died. My childhood was over.\n\n(Source: YouTube)",
