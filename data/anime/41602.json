  "synopsis": "All her life, Tsubomi Kido has lived trapped within a garden in her mind, staring into a mirror and feeling nothing but self-hate. Even when she tries to speak, nothing comes out—her words unheard like a tree falling in an empty forest. When confronted by insurmountable problems, Kido has always hidden her face and fled. However, with the support of her friends, she might finally be able to let her voice ring out and move on from the weight of her past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
