  "synopsis": "Naoko Yamada-directed anime film Kimi no Iro (The Colors Within) released a special \"dance\" promotional video – though, it's a little more on-beat for the creator who enjoys showcasing her characters goofing around and showing their personality through movement.\n\nThe special dance trailer contains wholly original footage, presented in a TikTok-like format and follows the three main characters, Kimi, Totsuko and Rui, dancing along to the insert song \"Sui Kin Chi Ka Moku Dotten Amen\" with moves that are reminiscent of those popular with those who upload short-form dance videos.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll News, edited)",
