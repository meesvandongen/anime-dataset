  "synopsis": "Yuina Akagi is an ordinary high school freshman in Maebashi City, Gunma Prefecture—until a talking frog named Keroppe appears and throws an unexpected proposal her way:\n\n\"Why don't you become a witch?\"\n\nBefore she knows it, Yuina's closet becomes a gateway to a mysterious world, where she meets four other girls—each with their own quirks and magical potential. There's the fiery Azu Niisato, the level-headed Kyouka Kitahara, the ever-optimistic Choco Mitsumata, and the carefree Mai Kamiizumi.\n\nTogether, they form the Maebashi Witches, a group dedicated to granting people's wishes through magic, music, and a bit of mayhem. Their base of operation? A charming little flower shop in the heart of the shopping district—where the flowers of the heart can finally bloom.\n\nWith a little magic and a lot of heart, their new life as witches is about to begin.\n\n(Source: MAL News)\n",
