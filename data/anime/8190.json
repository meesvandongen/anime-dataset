  "synopsis": "Despite the uncertainty surrounding Shinichi Chiaki's relationship with eccentric pianist Megumi \"Nodame\" Noda, most would assume it is a romantic one—especially Nodame herself, who has professed her love for Chiaki on many occasions. But when a petty quarrel over soy sauce leads Nodame to gratuitously accept a date invitation from Lucas Beaudry, a young French piano prodigy, the highly acclaimed conductor Chiaki experiences true jealousy for the first time in his life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
