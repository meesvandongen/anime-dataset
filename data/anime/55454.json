  "synopsis": "Following the most recent brutal battle, the gods now hold the lead against mortals in the one-on-one tournament that will decide the fate of humanity. With three wins under the belt of the divine beings, the humans only have 10 matches left to save themselves from extermination. The Supreme God Zeus intends to take the upper hand by sending Buddha—a benevolent demigod loved by all of humanity—into the fray.\n\nIn a shocking twist, Buddha announces his intention to fight for humanity. Enraged by this betrayal, the gods call upon the Seven Gods of Fortune to take Buddha down. As their battle rages on, a mysterious entity manifests in the middle of the arena, throwing the entire competition into disarray.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
