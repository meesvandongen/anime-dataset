  "synopsis": "Being an experienced teacher, Busujima fills students' heads with high-quality knowledge. One day, exchange students from the succubus kingdom come to study with him. These insidious and ugly creatures completely refuse to learn, and the quiet life of a man is turned upside down. But he wouldn't be called Busujima for nothing. Raised according to samurai traditions, he intends to walk his path to the very end and fulfill his teaching duty – to drum into the disobedient succubi the desire to learn, one way or another.",
