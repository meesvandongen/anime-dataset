  "synopsis": "To defeat the demon lord Valvaran, Arnelia assembled a group of elite warriors who fought in a massive battle for the sake of their homeland. However, right before the final stand, Valvaran successfully activated a combat art which allowed her to be reincarnated in modern Kyoto.\n\nRefusing to let the demon lord get away, Arnelia and her warriors followed Valvaran into this new world. However, now living in the body of an elementary-school student, Valvaran no longer poses much of a threat and has even been cooperative in helping the warriors track down the remaining pieces of her energy. As the warriors adapt to their now laid-back lives, Arnelia wonders whether they can really trust that these peaceful days will continue.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
