  "synopsis": "Due to rising sea levels and a rapidly declining human population, androids have been engineered to perform most menial tasks, allowing humans to focus on other things. Aside from providing manual labor and customer service, androids also entertain humans through Babel—a tower where participants captivate audiences with song and dance to clear Climb Stages. The higher the climb, the more prize money is awarded.\n\nAndroids Cobalt, Chrom, Neon, and Kei are down on their luck and about to have their electricity cut off from unpaid bills. Desperate to make a quick buck, the group decide to become Babel climbers. However, winning the audience's favor is a great challenge. Dejected but unwilling to give up, Cobalt resolves to somehow improve their chances after watching an impressive performance by STAND-ALONE—the top climber unit.\n\nWhen the group stumbles across a mysterious choreographer willing to give away his routine, Cobalt sees this as their only way up. With the help of their human companion, Esora Shibaura, the androids form the unit KNoCC to tackle the daunting climb to the top of Babel, but they must also overcome android-based discrimination along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
