  "synopsis": "For as long as anyone can remember, the Spooner Continent has been under the dominion of ruthless sorcerers. Obeying no laws but their own, they see humans as nothing more than tools to fulfill their dark magical rituals. The rest of the terrified population can do little to resist their cruel overlords.\n\nYet, even in the most trying times, hope persists. A small group of brave individuals has begun to fight back against this tyranny. In their quest for justice against the sorcerers who have gone too far, brothers Carrot and Marron Glace, sisters Tira and Chocolate Misu, and warrior Gateau Mocha travel across the land, challenging the sorcerers' reign and igniting flames of rebellion.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
