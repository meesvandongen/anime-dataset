Even an extraterrestrial being like him, however, needs a chance to rest.\n\nNot even the Rangers—a team solely dedicated to defeating the General and his colleagues—will stand in the way of him visiting pandas at the zoo, buying ice cream at the convenience store, and enjoying his well-deserved day off from committing evil deeds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
