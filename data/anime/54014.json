  "synopsis": "Spring has arrived at the little restaurant, and owner Li Linke and his fellow culinary enthusiast Wu Di have developed many new dishes for their customers. Regulars are flocking back, and the restaurant has also attracted many new faces, bringing with them fresh stories—a father and son with a strained relationship, college students planning to participate in an animation competition, and a toy salesman with a non-standard Mandarin accent. They will all find the flavors they've been longing for in the little restaurant.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
