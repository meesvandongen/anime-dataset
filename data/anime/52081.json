  "synopsis": "For more than four hundred years, the Takamimi Shrine has stood in Tokyo, enshrining the local goddess: Elda, a magical elf summoned from another world. The immortal elf has been served for 15 generations by the family who summoned her in the Edo period. Now, after Koito Koganei turns 16 years old, this responsibility falls onto her.\n\nServing as Elda's shrine maiden, Koito must balance her responsibilities with her daily school life. This proves to be difficult because Elda is a total social recluse who loves video games, collecting toys, and eating snacks. In an effort to get the lazy shut-in to experience more of the outside world, Koito juggles her time between indulging Elda's various hobbies and getting her to interact with the rest of humanity. Along the way, Koito learns more about the history of the area and what makes the goddess so loved and spoiled by the locals.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
