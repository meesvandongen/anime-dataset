  "synopsis": "The locals know all about Dr. Fuwa. His reputation for taking advantage of his female patients has left him little to do except his nurse Megumi. When he`s suddenly called in to investigate a mysterious illness that`s been affecting the nuns on a remote island, Dr. Fuwa`s certainly not above having a little fun with the patients – each and every one of them a cute little nun-in-training. But will he be able to uncover the truth behind their terrible condition? \n\n(Source: AniDB)",
