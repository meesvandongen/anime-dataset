  "synopsis": "In the wake of Aichi Sendou's heroic defeat of Link Joker, Toshiki Kai believes the world has returned to normal. However, during a routine visit to Card Capital, Kai discovers that everyone else has completely forgotten who Aichi is. Compelled to solve the mystery behind his friend's disappearance, Kai sets out to look for clues.\n\nWhile searching Aichi's high school, Kai sees a vision of Blaster Blade, Aichi's favorite Cardfight Vanguard unit. Suddenly, a stack of cards materializes in his hand: Aichi's Royal Paladin deck. Using these familiar cards, Kai challenges Aichi's companions to duels that help them recall their dear friend's impact on their lives. After regaining their memories, they join forces with Kai to find Aichi-—and to bring him home at any cost.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
