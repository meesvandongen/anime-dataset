When the tin tree lights up, Santa and Rudolph can deliver presents to children without getting lost. However, on the way, they encounter a snowstorm, and the tree and Burikid are thrown out of the spaceship in their container. Anpanman and his friends find Burikid's spaceship, where no one is on board, and they split up to search for Burikid. Meanwhile, Baikinman, who mistakes Burikid for a tin toy, appears in his Baikin Buri Robot to ruin Christmas Eve...\n\nWill Anpanman and his friends be able to deliver the tin tree to Santa and distribute presents to children...?\n\n(Source: Amazon, translated)",
