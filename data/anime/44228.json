  "synopsis": "The story shifts its setting from the grand martial arts world and imperial court to the bustling, ordinary streets of the city. Shen Jianxin, invited by the sect leader Li Wangsheng, travels to Chang'an to establish a branch of the Chunyang Palace, making a living by setting up a fortune-telling stall. During his time as a \"Chang'an drifter,\" Shen Jianxin is no longer the renowned martial arts master with the protagonist's halo. Due to some misconceptions about the world and insufficient judgment of his current situation, he encounters a series of strange and amusing events. Like many young people struggling in big cities, he experiences the bittersweet life of a \"Chang'an drifter,\" yet remains optimistic, ambitious, and full of chivalrous spirit.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
