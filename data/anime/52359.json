  "synopsis": "Twenty-seven-year-old salarywoman Midori Akitsu suddenly dies in her apartment due to overwork. As her spirit leaves her body, God appears before her, offering Midori a second chance at life in another world called Asdyllon. There, she must observe how badly humans persecute other species and judge if they should continue existing.\n\nTo help her get started, God grants Midori a special ability: to be liked by all kinds of non-humans—whether it be animals or holy beasts—enabling her to embrace and cuddle them as much as she wants. Now reborn as Nefertima Osfe, a duke's daughter, she enjoys her new life to the fullest alongside her adorable companions. However, it will not be long before she discovers what her task truly entails and that her time in this world will not always be fluffy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
