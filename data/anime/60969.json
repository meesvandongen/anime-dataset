  "synopsis": "Sae Iwata was never cute or dainty like the other girls, and due to her build and strength, she always felt the need to look after her delicate childhood friend and crush, Kouki Kamishiro. But as years passed, Kouki grew taller and more confident, which resulted in them drifting apart.\n\nToward the end of middle school, Sae reconnects with Kouki. Seeing that Kouki is still the sweet boy she once knew, she realizes that her dormant feelings for him have resurfaced. She tries her best to suppress her emotions—but it becomes even more difficult as, come high school, they end up in the same class. Ignoring her deepening feelings may seem like a fool's errand, but this boy that shines brighter than the sun may just prove to be her destiny.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
