  "synopsis": "Once upon a time, when television broadcasting itself was an adventure.\n\nThe invention of the television has made it possible to broadcast any event, however it is still an era where swords and sorcery abound. It has come for the cameras to turn their lens towards the darkness of dungeons, previously only known to adventurers.\n\nFighting countless monsters and constant equipment problems, the camera-wielding adventurers continued on, hoping to broadcast the first live dungeon capture. What may await them ahead?\n\n(Source: Official Youtube channel)",
