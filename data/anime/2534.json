  "synopsis": "One woman, simply known as The Queen, rules over the universe. By harnessing the elemental powers of her nine Guardians, she nurtures life on many planets. When it is time for The Queen to appoint a successor, she sees promise within two young maidens, Angelique Limoges and Rosalia de Catargena, and she gives them a test: utilize the power of the Guardians to cultivate life and prosperity on an uninhabited planet. However, Angelique is much less prepared than her rival; she must carefully foster relationships with the Guardians if she stands any chance at success.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
