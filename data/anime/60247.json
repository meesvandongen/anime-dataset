  "synopsis": "The vast expanse of the boundless silver sea conceals countless fiendlings beneath its surface. Border villages fall under the onslaught of these fiendlings, and even the once-bright moon above has turned into a tyrant.\n\n\"Whomst defends the world's justice? Whomst sees through the deceit of vice and indulgence? Whomst will wipe out these evildoers? Whomst will protect the light of ten thousand homes?\"\n\nThe weak are silenced by sinister laughter, leaving only a sorrowful sigh. But when the people raise their heads to the sky, the falling stars beyond the heavens have already answered—\n\nA dazzling blaze of otherworldly fire will soon obliterate the calamities of this realm. This is the divine retribution of the Mappou Age of the Dharma, delivered by the Ninja Heroes patrolling the sea of stars.\n\n(Source: Youtube)",
