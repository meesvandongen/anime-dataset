  "synopsis": "Haeun is a nobleman who falls hard for Dullseh, his gorgeous, but extremely clueless manservant. Dullseh's impressive build reminds Haeun of the sexy men from gay erotica that he loves so much. Exams and career ambitions be damned—he just can't get Dullseh out of his mind! Silly hijinks ensue as Haeun will do whatever it takes to lure the hunky Dullseh into his bedchamber and possibly... his heart?!\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
