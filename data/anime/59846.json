  "synopsis": "Ever since childhood, Scarlet El Vandimion has preferred to deal with wrongdoers by using her fists. However, to preserve her family's image, she suppresses her instincts and tolerates the abuse inflicted by her childish fiancé, Second Prince Kyle Von Pallistan. Only Kyle's brother, First Prince Julius, is aware that there is more to Scarlet than meets the eye, but she cares little about his growing interest.\n\nIn the middle of a ball, Kyle accuses Scarlet of harassing Terenezza Hopkins, a commoner that has taken his heart. Scarlet's engagement to Kyle is nullified, leaving her outraged that all of her efforts to endure thus far have amounted to nothing. Scarlet dons her studded leather gloves, once again becoming the \"Mad Dog Princess.\" Joined by Julius and werebeast Nanaka, Scarlet is ready to give filthy nobles a taste of their own medicine—one punch at a time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
