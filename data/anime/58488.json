  "synopsis": "The chaotic aftermath of a confrontation between Jinka Yamato and Yazen results in the power dynamics between the magically gifted katawara and humans being turned upside down. As the news of the downfall of dangaishu—the katawara-hunting monks led by Yazen—spreads across the country, rogue groups of katawara start to form, worsening the already-fragile relationship between them and humanity.\n\nHaving lost faith in his abilities, Shinsuke Hyoudou now spends his time heavily drinking in the company of Senya, a former enemy of his who controls one thousand katawara within his body. Senya indirectly causes the death of the father of Tsukiko, his newfound friend, after a surprise attack of a local god gone berserk.\n\nDespite the circumstances, Tsukiko holds no grudge against Senya and is determined to become Shinsuke's disciple no matter what. Although Shinsuke refuses to become Tsukiko's sword instructor, he reluctantly agrees to let her travel with him and Senya. While the unlikely trio heads towards their next destination, Tama Youko continues her journey to find the trail of Jinka, the nine-tailed fox who has the power to destroy the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
