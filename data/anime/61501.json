  "synopsis": "Kanan is a demon who descends upon the human world with one goal: to feast on the sweetest delicacy of all—young human souls. Disguised as a high schooler, she sets her sights on her first target, an unassuming boy named Youji Kyougi. But just as she prepares to claim her meal, things take a very unexpected turn.\n\nInstead of devouring him, Kanan ends up forming a \"romantic contract\" with Youji. For someone who's lived for millennia without experiencing love, navigating high school romance proves more terrifying than any hunt. Between awkward dates, hand-holding mishaps, and feelings she can't quite name, the once-proud demon finds herself flustered at every turn.\n\nA supernatural romcom about a lovestruck demon and the boy who was supposed to be her prey—sweet, chaotic, and full of firsts.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
