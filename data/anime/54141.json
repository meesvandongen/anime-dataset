  "synopsis": "Two years after the heroic sacrifice of Dark Schneider in the battle against Abigail, Kall-Su, the final surviving member of the Four Divine Kings, is close to seizing global power. As cities and kingdoms fall one after the other, humanity's last beacon of hope is a group of samurai led by the high priestess Yoko Tia Noto. However, the brutal assaults of Kall-Su's lieutenants against the samurai's fortress quickly make the situation desperate. Once more, Yoko's only way to fix the rapidly devolving crisis is to find Dark Schneider's soul, which has seemingly deserted Lucien Renlen's body since the demise of the kingdom of Metallicana.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
