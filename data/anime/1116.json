  "synopsis": "Sixth grade student Hiromi Nozawa leads a troubled life. With her parents frequently absent due to work, one of her only companions is her talking dog, Junkers. Though Hiromi puts on a brave face for the public, the stark reality is that she is heavily stressed, and she shares this side of herself only with Junkers.\n\nAfter hearing that her parents are considering divorce, Hiromi's stress reaches an all-time high; at this time, Junkers reveals that he has the ability to make three miracles occur. Given the potential of this newfound power, Hiromi must wish carefully—as obtaining what she thinks she wants may end up hurting those she cares about most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
