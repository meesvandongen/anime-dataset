Beings who move through water as they please, masters of geomancy and treasure hunting. Yi Sa, the last of her line, runs an \"underwater bank\" along the Lancang. During a perilous \"Golden Soup\" dive, she rescues Zong Hang. Seeking truth and a cure for her own fate, Yi Sa trains him as a Water Ghost. Together with Ding Yu Die of the Ding clan, the trio descends into the primordial \"Ancestral Golden Soup.\"\n\n(Source: WeTV)",
