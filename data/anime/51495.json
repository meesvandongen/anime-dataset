  "synopsis": "Thanks to the Fruit of Evolution, Seiichi Hiiragi's amazing new life in another world allows him to meet dependable allies and create formidable spells. His abilities catch the attention of Barnabus Ablitt, the principal of the Barbador Academy of Magic, who invites Seiichi to become a teacher at the institution. Coincidentally, Seiichi's classmates from Earth are enrolled there, which will lead to an awkward reunion if he is to meet them.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, an enigmatic cult called The Great Devil Order devises a sinister scheme to resurrect their deity and sacrifice the students of Barbador to hasten the process. As Seiichi's power is second to none, it is up to him to protect not only his friends but also the entire world from the looming darkness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
