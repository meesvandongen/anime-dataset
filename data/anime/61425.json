  "synopsis": "Sakuradaimon takes his role on the school's Public Morals Committee very seriously. Every day, he dutifully checks students' appearances at the school gate—most often scolding Kohinata, a rule-breaking girl with bright hair and a short skirt.\n\nThough she finds his constant lecturing annoying, everything changes when she discovers that Sakuradaimon is actually a bit of a mess himself.\n\nA lighthearted short romantic comedy about a strict committee member, a bold classmate, and the chaotic school life that brings them together.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
