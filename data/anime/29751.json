What came from within the ship was a little girl who called herself Yurumi. \"We're from the cosmic repair shop, 'Rutsubo Mechanic Company,'\" said another girl, Yurumi's partner, Shimeru, who stepped out afterwards. \nAnd so, in the Mukai household, a comedy of cosmic proportions unfolds!\n\n(Source: MU)",
