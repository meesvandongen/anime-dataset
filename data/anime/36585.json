As if by fate, a man comes to her clinic to explain the Doctor to Doctor program, which connects an experienced doctor with a younger one who can take over their practice after they retire. Though skeptical, the physician decides to hear the man out as she keeps her patients' best interest in mind.\n\nOjii-san no Kusuri\nAn anxious, elderly man arrives at a pharmacy to get his prescriptions filled, but he is ashamed that he cannot understand the instructions for his medication. Seeing his patient struggle, the pharmacist proposes a new and simpler way to dispense his medications that will ensure the patient does not miss another dose.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
