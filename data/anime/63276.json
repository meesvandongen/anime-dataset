  "synopsis": "Ame is a child who loves sweets. But inside her mouth lived a cavity named Caries! Caries calls Ame \"Mama\" and acts completely unrestrained, using her teeth as furniture and even taking over her body. Ame is constantly being bossed around by Caries.\n\nAme and Caries—a slightly unusual mother-daughter duo!? A slapstick comedy about their chaotic daily lives!\n\n(Source: Official site, translated)",
