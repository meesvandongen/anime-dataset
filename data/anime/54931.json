  "synopsis": "Wu Ran, known as the number one good-for-nothing, accidentally activated the Sacred Soul Dice System, a treasure of the universe, while severely injured in battle. This granted him strange and wondrous divine dice skills, allowing him to rescue his junior uncle and defeat the female cultivator Ni Sha. However, unexpectedly, Ni Sha developed feelings for him and sought to capture him and bring him back to her sect. Ni Sha, in alliance with the White Dragon King, launched an attack on Earth's city, aiming to obtain the Sacred Soul Dice. Ultimately, Wu Ran defeats Ni Sha and protects Earth's city.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
