  "synopsis": "Over a century ago, astral mages under persecution from the Empire banded together and established the Nebulis Sovereignty under three founding families: Lou, Hydra, and Zoa. With the leadership of Millavair Lou Nebulis VIII, the Sovereignty aims to minimize casualties in their conflict with the Empire—a stance the extremist Zoas disagree with. Tensions rise between the families as the upcoming election to decide the next leader approaches. The Zoas are willing to do anything to achieve success; however, a world-ending war may ensue should they be victorious.\n\nPrincess Aliceliese \"Alice\" Lou Nebulis XI has no choice but to cooperate with any potential allies in order to advance towards her ultimate goal of ending the conflict that has long tormented everyone involved. This includes Iska—one of the Empire's greatest warriors and her greatest rival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
