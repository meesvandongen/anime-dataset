  "synopsis": "2,500 years ago, the Jewish people were under the rule of the powerful Medo-Persia. Many Jews settled in this country and lived freely believing in their God, Jehovah, with the permission of King Ahasuerus. Mordecai, a virtuous Jew who worked at the palace gate, had a pretty cousin named Esther who had lost her parents at an early age. Esther, who had a gentle and wise personality, later became the queen of the great empire of Medo-Persia. Meanwhile, Haman, who had a cruel personality, plotted with the king that Mordecai was disobeying the king's law and committing anti-national acts, and the king, enraged, ordered all the Jews to be killed. Queen Esther risked her life to save her people.\n\n(Source: KMDb)",
