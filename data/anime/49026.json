  "synopsis": "Mystery Camp\nRelaxing in the heart of nature is a constant joy for Nadeshiko Kagamihara, Aoi Inuyama, and their friends. But when the camping experience changes in unexpected ways, one can only be curious about the extraordinary wonders that have yet to be explored.\n\nTabisuru Shima Rin\nGathered around a campfire, the girls of the Outdoor Activities Club and Ena Saitou all propose various ideas to Rin Shima for her next trip. However, their suggestions are tailored to their personal preferences—not to mention that Rin has plans of her own. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
