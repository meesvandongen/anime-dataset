  "synopsis": "An aloof junior high school boy meets a cheerful high school girl inside a Lotte shop where they both reach for the same chocolate bar. Before he can react, she takes a different candy instead and leaves with her purchase. Continuing to dwell on the missed connection, the boy hopes that he can meet the girl again and gift her the sweet she originally wanted—with the addition of his feelings.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
