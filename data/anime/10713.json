It is not long, however, before both the Attractors and the Custos notice a mysterious string of murders that all share a connection with flowers. Realizing that the culprit must be an Attractor, the Custos move in to eliminate their target while Quon Mitsuchi plans to save them. Will Quon be able to save an Attractor that is also a serial murderer, or will he ultimately waver in his values?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
