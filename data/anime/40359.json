Makoto knows all of the ins and outs of the bustling Tokyo district and strives to maintain peace alongside the G-Boys, who assist Makoto in his troubleshooting endeavors. Led by the charismatic and ruthless Takashi Andou, the G-Boys is the most influential gang in all of Ikebukuro. \n\nHowever, when the new faction \"Red Angels\" begins to move in on the G-Boys' turf, immediate tensions rise between them.
