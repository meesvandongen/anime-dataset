  "synopsis": "Shigeyuki \"Peter\" Honda tries to balance his life as a work-from-home illustrator and homemaker while his girlfriend, Eri Todani, works to climb the corporate ranks. Though they have lived happily like this for two years, Peter feels something is missing: he desperately wants to get married and have a child. Unfortunately, Eri's career-focused mindset leaves no room to start a family. As the two try to reconcile their differences, they wonder if their seemingly picturesque relationship can survive this daunting obstacle.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
