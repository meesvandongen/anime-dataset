  "synopsis": "As novelist Fuji is returning home in a rainstorm, her attention is caught by something peculiar: an animal resembling a dog asking her to take it in. Although she is reluctant at first, the animal impresses her by handing her an umbrella, resulting in Fuji welcoming the creature into her apartment.\n\nSoon, Fuji realizes that the animal is even smarter than she initially thought, as it begins communicating with her through writing. Whether the two are alone or hanging out with her family and friends, Fuji's new little friend never fails to entertain with its whimsical actions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
