  "synopsis": "In the end, all that remains is a story. This story is that of Ayano Tateyama, whose fleeting existence left behind only memories. What does she remember when life flashes before her eyes? For her, more than anything else, she recalls regrets—of things left unsaid and feelings of love she could never convey.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
