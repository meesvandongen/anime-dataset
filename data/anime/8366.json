An authority on biotechnology and a developer of \"konjaclone\" technology, Amigo Suzuki carries out \"Transformation Plans for Samba World\", in which he makes human clones using konjac as a material and makes them dance a samba. In Kasukabe city, people switch places with false ones who look just like the real persons. The Nohara family and the members of Kasukabe Defense Forces try to escape from Kasukabe with the help of a mystery beautiful girl Jacqueline Feeney (Jackie). \n\n(Source: Manabu Tsuribe)",
