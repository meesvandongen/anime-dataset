  "synopsis": "The Funny-face Club are technically high school students, but that's where the normal part ends. The five members (Rei Ichidou, Gou Reietsu, Kiyoshi Shusse, Dai Monohoshi, and Jin Daima) all have unique faces and even more unique personalities. Whether you're talking about temperaments, intellect, physical quirks, or behavior, they're all complete weirdos! Alongside them are other colorful groups at school like the Pretty-boy Brigade, the Buckle-down Bunch, and the Rebel Crew, alongside classmates like Yui Kawa and Chie Uru, and all their teachers who also get caught up in the chaos. Together, they dive headfirst into a nonstop series of wacky, wild antics.\n\nIt's a story packed with absurdity, nonsense, unpredictability, and utter madness, featuring five hopeless underachievers that will stay in your memory forever!\n\n(Source: It's Anime)",
