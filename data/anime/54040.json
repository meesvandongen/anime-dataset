  "synopsis": "Due to Earth's increasing climate crisis, humanity has developed futuristic technology to migrate to the Moon. Tomura Sawyer works as a courier in the higher areas, saving money for his little brother, Haru, who suffers from Smoky Moon Disease - a sickness produced by the smoke and polution from the lower areas. The two siblings dream of moving to the higher, cleaner areas to treat this disease.\n\nTomura takes a gamble to do the impossible: to participate in the TV program \"Run for Money\" and to win against all the other contestants even if he doesn't have the Chrono Bracelet required for it. A producer of said program by the name of Harvest seems to take an interest in Tomura's determination to participate, so she gifts him the Bracelet and allows him to participate. In this glorified game of Tag, Tomura Sawyer must last longer than anyone else without being touched by the enemies in this game — the Hunters.",
