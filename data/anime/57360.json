  "synopsis": "In recent years, creatures known as Kaii have frequently attacked cities and wrought destruction. Exterminating these monsters quickly became a popular and well-respected profession, carried out by magical girls. More than five hundred magical girl companies, ranging from small ventures to large corporations, offer their aid to those who need it.\n\nKana Sakuragi is a studious college graduate struggling to land a job despite attending numerous interviews. But when a Kaii attacks during her latest interview, she finds herself assisting the magical girl responding to the crisis. Although she lacks battle experience, Kana relies on her exceptional memory and knowledge to help subdue the monster.\n\nHitomi Koshigaya, the headstrong magical girl who faced the Kaii, recognizes Kana's potential and invites her to join Magilumiere Magical Girls Inc.—the startup where Hitomi works. Wishing to make a difference, Kana accepts the offer to become a magical girl herself. While Kana may not be suited for the corporate world, it soon becomes clear that her true calling is to rise as one of the most talented magical girls in existence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
