  "synopsis": "Yoshika Miyafuji spends her days peacefully after returning to her hometown. Her former superior officer Mio Sakamoto and others arranged for Yoshika to study abroad at a medical school in Europe. Yoshika returns to Europe with Shizuka Hattori, who was Sakamoto's student at the naval academy. As Yoshika returns to Europe and new signs of Neuroi emerge, the other former members of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, who were scattered in various locations, also begin to gather again. A powerful Neuroi then appears before Yoshika and Shizuka.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
