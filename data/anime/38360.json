Meanwhile, Naoshi Kanno bolsters his beastman forces with the addition of the cat tribe. After receiving an unexpected envoy from Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi—a fellow Imperial Japanese Armed Forces member—Kanno, along with Scipio Africanus, sets out to meet a man he thought to be dead.\n\nAs his enemies prepare for war, the Black King mobilizes his army, giving command to a certain Drifter's sworn enemy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
