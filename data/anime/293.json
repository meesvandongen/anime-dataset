  "synopsis": "Having infiltrated Earth with blind ambitions of stardom, Princess Di Gi Charat—also known as Dejiko—of the planet Di Gi Charat quickly realizes that money makes the world go around, of which she has none. On a never-ending, futile mission to change her socioeconomic status, Dejiko, her sidekick Petit Charat \"Puchiko\", her royal guardian Gema, and her competitive coworker Hikaru Usada try everything in their power to overturn the soul-crushing mundanity of working in retail—all in a series of surreal yet ironically relatable attempts at spicing up their daily lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
