He is magically shrunk and suddenly the farm animals are out for revenge. He flees on the back of the goose Morten and they join up with a flock of wild geese. Together they travel all over Sweden, with Nils hoping to find a way to become big again. \n\n(Source: ANN) \n\nNote: No theatrical release was actually made and it became available to the general public as an OVA in 1985.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
