Ignorant of their relationship, their common friend, Ohashi, visits the café as usual to see Tamaki whom he secretly loves. However, Kurono notices Ohashi's feelings. In order to incite him into confessing his feelings to her, Kurono molests Tamaki and makes her wait on him as she is. As she was sexually excited, she gives off a female's scent, which, in turn, excites Ohashi. Meanwhile, Tomoe, a friend of Kurono's appears...
