  "synopsis": "Two horny college slackers and a beautiful professor. A frustrated TV reporter. A sexy track star and her tempted coach. And a high school girlzilla that’s the size of the Empire State building. Colorful! contains over 50 vignettes of men, women, and the pursuit of… well, you’ll just have to see.\n\nFrom hotties on subways and perverted cabbies, to panty-obsessed video geeks, sexy mall babes, and the furry phenomenon, Colorful! is a strange, deranged, racy and hilarious dose of animated Viagra! (And if live action is more your style, check out the behind-the-scenes documentary that shows the twisted, demented cast and crew that bring Colorful! to vivid life!)\n\n(Source: ADV Films)",
