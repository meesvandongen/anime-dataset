  "synopsis": "The story is about a protagonist known only as \"I,\" who undergoes a perpetual cycle of reincarnation. The story is set in an alternate world where each individual is given the freedom to choose their next form. However, due to a recent surge in applicants, the waiting list for popular roles—such as \"Demon King\" or \"Hero with Cheat Skills and a Harem\"—has reached to 50,000 years.\n\nRefusing to wait, the protagonist chooses to reincarnate repeatedly into increasingly bizarre forms. These roles range from the rib of a hero leading a harem to a hermit crab, a vegetable, and even a number of explosives designed to bring happiness to people.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
