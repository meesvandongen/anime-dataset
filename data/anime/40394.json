People are going wild with excitement at the world championships, THE ZENON.\n\nOne day, Souta Azuma, an average high school student, is challenged to a battle by a mysterious woman, Eilietta Lash. She reveals that she’s a Codeman and that her intent is to team up with Souta and participate in THE ZENON. Souta reluctantly agrees. Souta and Eilietta’s first opponent turns out to be the super-famous player Shion Saionji, who attends Souta’s school, and her buddy, Ash Claude.\n\n(Source: Official YouTube)",
