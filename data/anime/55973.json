  "synopsis": "When mundane office worker Kiyoshi Adachi turns 30 years old, he discovers that he has gained the ability to read minds due simply to remaining a virgin for his entire life. The caveat, however, is that he must make physical contact with a person to know what they are thinking about. Adachi believes there is no real use for this power until he accidentally hears the thoughts of his coworker, Yuuichi Kurosawa.\n\nCharismatic and dependable, Kurosawa is the star of Adachi's team at work, earning praise and admiration from everyone at the office. But deep within, Kurosawa harbors an intense one-sided crush for the gloomy Adachi—a fact that Adachi only learns because of his ability, and knowledge he tries to respectfully disregard. As Kurosawa treats Adachi with kindness and affection he has never experienced before, Adachi finds it increasingly difficult to ignore his coworker's genuine advances.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
