  "synopsis": "Ever since a vending machine enthusiast was reincarnated as one named Boxxo, he has become a pivotal part of the village of Clearflow Lake. With his ability to turn into any kind of vending machine and serve a variety of products, Boxxo has helped the settlement grow and has fought various formidable enemies alongside his first and most loyal customer, Lammis.\n\nHowever, Boxxo and Lammis' recent battle with the Netherlord, a general serving under the Demon Lord, has left the future uncertain. To take action against the looming threat, the directors of each Hunter Association agree to strike back by dispatching their best hunters. Joined by friends old and new, Boxxo and Lammis must thwart the Netherlord's evil plans by any means necessary to protect all that they cherish.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
