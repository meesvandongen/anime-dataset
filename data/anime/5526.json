  "synopsis": "Satoshi, Kasumi, and Takeshi surprise their Pokémon with a summertime retreat at a resort called Pokémon Plaza, where Pokémon of all types can relax and have fun outside their Poké Balls.\n\nIn the midst of so many boisterous Pokémon, Pikachu, Fushigidane, and Zenigame take turns soothing Kasumi's distressed Togepi and trying to lull it to sleep. But when an especially rowdy quartet consisting of Raichu, Bulu, Maril, and Karakara appears and causes Togepi to awaken, Pikachu's relaxing vacation is put in jeopardy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
