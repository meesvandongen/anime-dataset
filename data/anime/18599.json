  "synopsis": "After eating a strange flower, Chocotan the mini dachshund gains the ability to talk! Since then, the eager pup has been able to provide her young owner, Nao Hatori, with earnest support.\n\nThe two often walk to the park in hopes of running into Hatori's crush, Yamato Arima, and his dachshund Happy. During one encounter, Arima is interrupted by his female classmates, distancing Hatori from their conversation. To make matters worse, Chocotan loses her ability to speak and is unable to console her now devastated owner. Despite these setbacks, Chocotan's steadfast love for her human companion motivates Hatori to muster the courage to realize her genuine feelings.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
