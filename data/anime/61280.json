  "synopsis": "Ai Yasumi, a first-year high school student living on Izu-Oshima, loves manga more than anything. When she learns that her long-admired, yet long-inactive, favorite manga artist Hoshi no Rei will be exhibiting at COMITIA, she sets off on a journey to Tokyo.\n\nWhat she doesn't expect, however, is that a fateful encounter at the event will change her life forever.\n\n\"How does one become a manga artist?\" Ai steps into the world of manga creation—a path she thought she understood, yet knows so little about. This is the story of a girl taking her first steps down the road to becoming a mangaka.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
