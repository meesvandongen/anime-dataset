  "synopsis": "Since ancient times, Dahe Shenzhou has been a land where virtue and evil have been at odds. Numerous justice-related sects have banded together to combat the evil's twelve irresponsible sects. The justice Jinyi Sect's low-level supernatural power is Li Wannian, who possesses ordinary cultivation. He wants to live a life of peace and quiet, lying flat in the Jinyi Sect and receiving a salary.\n\nHe unexpectedly learned, however, that he possessed the eternal capacity to instantly resurrect at the point of life-or-death crisis while completing a task to deal with the transfer. More significantly, he can improve his cultivation after each resurrection by receiving incentives in the form of points based on his overall performance at the time of his beheading. To put it another way, Li Wannian has to make a valiant sacrifice, and in a way that inspires and motivates others if he hopes to advance his cultivation.\n\n(Source: bilibili)",
