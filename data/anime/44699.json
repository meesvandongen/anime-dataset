  "synopsis": "Inside a Japanese restaurant, an incongruous white steamed bun stands on a neat bamboo curtain. He is Bao Qiang, representing a traditional Chinese delicacy. Bao Qiang possesses unparalleled martial arts skills; he arrives to challenge the restaurant, carrying a plaque proclaiming him the \"Sick Man of East Asia,\" vowing to uphold national pride. He brandishes nunchucks, his eyes filled with anger and disdain. Meanwhile, Salmon Roe Sushi, wielding a samurai sword, comes to meet him. Salmon Roe, outmatched, nearly decapitates himself, and when he clashes with Bao Qiang, he is utterly defeated and flees in disarray. The brave and fearless Bao Qiang is about to engage in a classic duel with the sushi enthusiasts that will be remembered for generations...\n\n(Source: Douban, translated)",
