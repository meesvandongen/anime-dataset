  "synopsis": "Bamboo Blade commercials featuring new animation. Some recycle scenarios such as Tama-chan sleeping in very high places or Miya-Miya fighting off drunk salary men in an RPG style. Others cross-over with each other like Azuma's space adventure scenario colliding with Yuuji's bicycle race scenario. The final commercial has all the characters meet together and take a photograph.",
