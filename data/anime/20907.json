  "synopsis": "Timid Masaya relies on his friend, second-grader Akiyo, to help him manage walking to school. Despite his tall stature, the path through a shadowy grove of trees is too frightening for him to enter alone.\n\nWhen a flower Akiyo is holding falls apart, Masaya wants to do something to cheer her up. Unfortunately, the only place that he can get bellflowers is a faraway field in the shadows of a lone pine tree—and getting there will be a far more frightening journey than his already difficult daily commute.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
