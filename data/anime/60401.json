The protagonist, Sakurako, has a typical university life, but everything changes with MuuMuu's arrival! What begins as an unexpected cohabitation quickly turns into a whirlwind of chaotic events. The chemistry between Sakurako and MuuMuu leads to a super-spectacular, appliance-filled, and cat comedy adventure. \n\n(Source: Pony Canyon)",
