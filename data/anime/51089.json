  "synopsis": "The ideal Valentine's Day gift is inarguably chocolate, neatly packaged in a box tied with a red ribbon.\n\nIn the morning, a schoolgirl carries boxed chocolate in her bag, nervous yet determined to deliver it to its intended recipient. By night, however, she has not followed through with her goal. There is still hope, as all she needed was a day's worth of time to muster up some courage. Overcoming her hesitation, the girl sends a decisive text message.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
