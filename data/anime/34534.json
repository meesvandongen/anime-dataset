  "synopsis": "One Night Sake Cup \nOn his way back home from an errand, Takashi Natsume gets lost in the forest. Luckily, he is rescued by a traveling youkai couple who make sake cups for a living. Taking a sip of water from one, Natsume feels a surge of energy rush throughout his body, thanks to the \"One Night Cup.\" It is a special cup that makes every drink delicious, but unfortunately, its effects last only for one night. The following day, Natsume attends the youkai banquet with his loyal protector, the sake-loving chubby cat Madara, and gets the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn how to make sake cups.\n\nParty of Fun & Games\nNatsume is filled with regret after hastily declining a rare invitation to a banquet from Madara. Curious, he chases after the cat to an old, run-down mansion but soon enough feels the uncanny presence of numerous youkai nearby. When he runs into the seductive youkai Hinoe, she explains that the empty estate serves as a hide-and-seek playground where the winning spirit acquires authority over a valley. With still no trace of Madara, Natsume starts having eerie dreams of the mansion, but this time as the game's participant.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
