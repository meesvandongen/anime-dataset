  "synopsis": "Though it has been one year since the Black Rebellion failed, the battle lives on, as the Holy Empire of Britannia attempts to expand its power worldwide, and the Black Knights work to regain theirs.\n\nAs a newly instated Knight of Rounds, Suzaku Kururugi is an indispensable asset in battle, though he has yet to bear the full weight of his title. Among his opposition, C.C. and Kallen Stadtfeld strengthen their bond as they work together on crucial missions for the Black Knights. Interspersed throughout the drama are lighthearted, humorous moments, including the Ashford Academy Student Council’s handmade dress party and the Black Knights' pajama party.\n\nBlending tragedy and comedy, Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 Picture Drama gives a behind-the-scenes look at the characters of its parent series, showcasing how they come to terms with their roles and each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
