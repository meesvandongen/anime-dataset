If he did not achieve anything within three years, he would be expelled from the sect. Yang Kai accidentally obtained a mysterious stone pillow, which opened up mysterious skills such as the Proud Golden Body. After that, he continued to practice, breaking through his own limits with his tenacious character as a young man, and finally stood at the top of the inheritance cave. Yang Kai and Su Yan inherited the mysterious skills together, and continued to start his story of becoming a legend and reaching the peak of martial arts.\n\n(Source: Tencent, Google translated)",
