  "synopsis": "After Earth was decimated by World War III, the ruins of civilization were rebuilt, with the futuristic city of Olympus standing out like a crown jewel. Overseen by the supercomputer Gaia and populated with an extremely large number of Bioroids—genetically engineered people designed to handle all administrative functions—Olympus affords its citizens lives free from all worries. However, a surge of crimes has been occurring within this seemingly utopian environment.\n\nIn order to protect the people, Deunan Knute and her partner Briareos Hecantochires work for Olympus' Enhanced SWAT team, taking on the most violent criminal cases. When a group of terrorists threaten to destroy the Olympians' way of life, Deunan and Briareos swear to take them down—no matter the cost.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
