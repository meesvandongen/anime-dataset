  "synopsis": "Shi Miao has a lot of experience dealing with her older brother's peculiar habits. After all her scolding, it is natural to expect that Shi Fen's antics would come to an end. But having spent their whole life together, it is obvious to Miao that some things never change—and maybe that is for the best.\n\nDespite his recklessness, Fen usually means well. As a result, a tight-knit friend group has formed around him and his sister. Joined by their classmates—Kai Xin, Wan Sui, and Miaomiao—the Shi siblings' tenure at high school continues to be an absolute spectacle.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
