  "synopsis": "Makoto goes to the summer festival with Ryuuko. Afterwards, as promised, he meets up with Erio in an old temple to look at the stars. As they watch the Perseid meteor shower, Yashiro appears to declare that she will leave but not before showing her esper powers. She tells Makoto to step back, and shortly afterwards a meteorite falls in the exact spot where he was previously standing, destroying the torii. He is left with just a small injury and becomes bewildered wondering if Yashiro was actually an esper and/or an alien and that he can't say for sure that aliens and espers are unreal. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
