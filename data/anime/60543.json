  "synopsis": "While the mission to exorcise Jin \"Jiji\" Enjouji's family home is underway, things are not going as expected. Momo Ayase narrowly evades an attempted abduction while Ken \"Okarun\" Takakura and Jiji are ambushed by the Kitou family—the unsettling landlords of the cursed estate. The trio's efforts threaten the foundation of this enigmatic town shrouded in legends and mysteries.\n\nAs Momo, Okarun, and Jiji are drawn deeper into the maze of folklore and supernatural entities, they must each utilize their unique powers if they want to survive and unravel the secrets of the uncanny town.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
