  "synopsis": "Through their combined effort, the members of PathTLIVE have made it to the Virtual Grid Awards at ADEN Academy. Miracle, Chris, Quan, Riz, and Noelle—along with several other top virtual artists—will compete in the main event of the ceremony: a Unit Battle, where participants enter as a team to compete for a spot in the main event's concert.\n\nAs the competition heats up, PathTLIVE reviews their competitors who have made it to the main event and evaluates if they have what it takes to win. But when the girls begin to lose confidence, they look inward to see how they can improve themselves to prepare for the Unit Battle. Through collaborations with other top performers, each girl explores new facets of what it means to be a virtual artist.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
