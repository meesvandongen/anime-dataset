  "synopsis": "Licca Kayama believes herself to be nothing more than the average 10-year-old girl; living in a quiet Japanese suburb with her mom and grandmother and spending her time in school and playing with her friends. Yet her two caretakers have kept one very important secret from her: Licca is in fact a princess of the hidden Doll Kingdom.\n\nWhile her class pays a visit to the local museum, Licca and her friends are suddenly accosted by the dangerous Scarecrow and his henchmen. Sent by the evil new rulers of the Doll Kingdom, these wicked minions will resort to every magical trick in the book for a chance at capturing the young princess. Licca's only hope is the arrival of the Doll Knights—once mighty guardians of the royal family, they are now the only thing that can fight against the darkness that has engulfed Licca's ancestral home.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
