  "synopsis": "Ever since she was a young girl, Sooha was told to hide her superhuman abilities to avoid getting mistaken for a vampire. Having been accused of being one and blamed for her childhood friend's death, Sooha enrolls in Decelis Academy—a night school where supernatural beings, such as vampires and werewolves, allegedly cannot enter.\n\nAt the academy, Sooha soon encounters Heli, a student who offers friendship despite discovering her secret. Heli introduces Sooha to his close friends—Jaan, Jino, Shion, Jakah, Noa, and Solon—who all have different powers as well. But their connection seems to run deeper than just that; they are curiously drawn to her, feeling as if they would do anything she wishes.\n\nIn light of a recent murder that is said to be the work of a vampire, Heli and his friends' unsettling history slowly unravels. While the seven boys try to shield Sooha from the world of the supernatural, she inevitably gets entangled in the centuries-old rivalry between vampires and werewolves. As tensions intensify, Sooha realizes that she may be closer than ever to the creatures she hates the most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
