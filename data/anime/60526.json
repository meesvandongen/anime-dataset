  "synopsis": "The 28-year-old Fang Ping was accidentally reborn in a parallel world in 2008, returning to his 18-year-old high school self. This is a world composed of a warrior system, where warriors have extremely high social status and rights. Due to the coincidence of fate with Emperor Zhan Tian in his previous life, a martial arts system was generated in Fang Ping's body after his rebirth. He can convert rare props of any value into martial arts value by touching them, and improve a series of abilities such as bones, tendons, flesh, blood, and mental strength at a speed beyond ordinary people. Through the system's golden finger and his own mind, Fang Ping successfully entered Modu Wuke University for further studies, and in the years to come, he continued to complete his self-growth. Faced with unknown difficulties, he gradually realized the responsibilities that warriors need to bear and the mission of protecting family, friendship, and love.\n\n(Source: Tencent, Google translated)",
