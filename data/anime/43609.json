  "synopsis": "What do Shuchiin Academy's model students do outside of their student council duties? After a visit to the swimming pool, Kaguya Shinomiya and Chika Fujiwara take to the showers to wash themselves off. When Chika accidentally drops a bar of soap, the two find themselves in a rather slippery mishap. \n\nMeanwhile, Miyuki Shirogane and Yuu Ishigami examine a discarded pornographic magazine—its content bearing an uncanny resemblance to the other student council members. Later on, an intense fried rice cook-off commences as Chika and Miko Iino seek to crown a master chef amongst the council. \n\nThese eccentric activities reveal a side of the student council that has never been seen before!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
