  "synopsis": "Naoya Mukai's crazy lifestyle of balancing his time between both of his girlfriends, Saki Saki and Nagisa Minase, is still as hectic as ever. Additionally, the blonde bombshell Rika Hoshizaki also has her sights on Naoya, complicating his already convoluted love life.\n\nAs if things could not get more ridiculous, another girl inserts herself into the situation: Shino Kiryuu, who is determined to end Naoya's two-timing and ensure Saki's happiness. However, Shino harbors secret feelings for Naoya—a longing she believes she must forsake—yet simply cannot due to the deep attraction he inspires.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
