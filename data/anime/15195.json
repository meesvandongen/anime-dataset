  "synopsis": "Few people wonder what occurs between warring nations when they are not fighting each other. In Hetalia, the countries find themselves outside of their usual setting: working together in a school newspaper club, reminiscing about former historical figures, and searching for Santa Claus? With the potential for comedic calamity always around the corner, there is no predicting what exactly these adventures entail!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
