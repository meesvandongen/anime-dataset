  "synopsis": "Dai Mugen once held an unmatched passion for playing the drums. However, after being defeated by rival drummer Rin Tanba in a competition, he is left questioning where his heart lies and quits as a result.\n\nOne day, Dai has a fateful encounter with a strange creature named Goutetsu, a self-proclaimed \"god.\" Spotting the boy's hidden potential, Goutetsu quickly appoints Dai as his \"oyakata\"—a coach who can guide Goutetsu in the world of \"kamizumo,\" the battles between gods through sumo wrestling. Within kamizumo matches, the gods are powered through the drumbeats struck by their oyakata, which forces Dai to pick up the mallets once more.\n\nAs the duo slowly racks up victories, Dai confronts his self-doubts and reignites his passion in the new endeavor to stand on kamizumo's topmost stage.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
