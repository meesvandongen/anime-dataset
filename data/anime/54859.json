  "synopsis": "Women's competitive cycling had been defunct for decades until the newly formed Rinkai League revived the sport, making headlines with its first few races. It has inspired many women across Japan, who flock to the league in hopes of realizing their dreams of becoming professional athletes.\n\nCycling enthusiast Izumi Itou is reluctant to stake her future on a racing competition, despite her friends' encouragement. That changes when she discovers that her grandmother is a former champion in women's cycling. She offers to train Izumi, hoping to help her recognize her own talent. Although Izumi lacks experience, the appearance of a fierce Swiss contestant who aims to dominate the competition motivates her to give it all on the track and, ultimately, win.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
