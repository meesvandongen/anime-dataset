  "synopsis": "Carefree, coquettish, and capricious, Tamala is the cutest girl-cat in dystopian Cat Tokyo, year 2030—or at any other point in the time/space continuum. She has randomly invited herself along on her detective friend Michelangelo's missing-person investigation. It seems the case is one of seven sudden vanishings in an astronomical pattern across Cat Japan that occurred at the exact same moment one night. Their search leads ever deeper into a mystery with ancient, occult roots and apocalyptic implications—and threads leading to Tamala herself. Shadowed by a covert agent of the Catty & Co. consortium, she may in fact be the greatest enigma. Indolent ingénue? Megacorporate mascot? Mythic messiah, or manifestation of cosmic malevolence? Anyhow, wow—she sure is a great dancer!\n\n(Source: Fantasia International Film Festival)",
