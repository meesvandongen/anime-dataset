  "synopsis": "A whale is being neglected and decayed since it has been drifted on the shore of Han River.\nSuch strange things happened but no one in the city cares, only a dog and birds are around the whale.\nThese sceneries are a remembrance of the depression which has been hanging over South Korea quite a while.\n\n(Source: vcrworks.kr)",
