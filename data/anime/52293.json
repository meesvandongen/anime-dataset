  "synopsis": "Panty and Stocking Anarchy, the angel twin sisters, have even more ghosts to exorcize in Daten City, thanks to the failed opening of the Hell Gate. They must continue their ghost hunt alongside their longtime rivals, the sisters Scanty and Kneesocks Demon, who must earn Hell Coins to return to Hell. On top of that, the Demon sisters are staying at the church with Garterbelt, the priest in charge of the Anarchy sisters. These two polar opposite duos will have to set aside their differences if they wish to collect enough Heaven and Hell Coins to complete their mission and return to their respective realms.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
