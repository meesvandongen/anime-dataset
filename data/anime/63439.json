  "synopsis": "Forced into a marriage of convenience based on mutual benefit, Jiang Yuan, an assassin from the Tai Xuan Tower, and Shao Yue, the holy maiden of the Jiu Xuan Sect, are ordered to marry. On their wedding night, they attempt an assassination, only to discover they are both immortal. To obtain the Demon-Suppressing Bell and the Demon-Controlling Bell, secret treasures of each other's sects, they transform from mortal enemies into a facade of marriage, engaging in a charade of mutual deception. \n\nHowever, neither is aware that the other is also an alien survivor whose home was destroyed by the \"Void.\" This destined couple forms an alliance amidst suspicion and testing, not only searching for the treasures transformed from a lost spaceship but also confronting the ever-watchful cultivation world, seeking hope to defeat the \"Void\" amidst perilous circumstances.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
