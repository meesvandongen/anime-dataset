  "synopsis": "For the most part, Wisdaregidor is your typical fantasy world: monsters wreaking havoc, taverns packed with gung-ho adventurers, and a demon overlord looking to rule it all. But Wisdaregidor has one thing you'll never find in Middle-earth: the Internet! Zane and Kuku are two adventurers trying to build a fanbase. The pair will do whatever it takes to get more subscribers for their streamed videos, even if it means taking on the demon lord himself!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
