  "synopsis": "People from various worlds and across different universes attend Kaginado Academy, a school of which its creation can only be attributed to a miracle. While everyone is trying to lead a normal school life, the clash of bustling personalities causes many of the students to beg questions about their world and the complexes they brought with them.\n\nRyou Fujibayashi feels like her life is dictated by how she is judged by others, expressing her jealousy toward other girls. Yukito Kunisaki constantly finds himself out of place and neglected, continuing to wander around unemployed and penniless. Meanwhile, Ayu Tsukimiya keeps running into the most untimely of situations—all while crashing into her surroundings along the way. Such is life at Kaginado Academy, and all the fourth wall breaking and comedic antics that come with it!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
