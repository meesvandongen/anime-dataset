  "synopsis": "For the 73rd class of cadets of the Defense University of the small planet Kibi, a shakedown cruise on the fleet's new starship \"Amaterasu\" is a fitting lead-up to graduation. As they are returning to their home planet, however, they are shocked to hear news of a declaration of war by the aggressive Kingdom against Kibi. When their planetary government surrenders without a struggle, the cadets decide to launch their own war, aboard the \"Amaterasu\".
