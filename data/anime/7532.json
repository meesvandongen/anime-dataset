  "synopsis": "Within a wintry forest live two woodcutters: one clad in black and the other in white. While the black-clad woodcutter sees no consequences for exploiting the forest's resources as much as he can, the white-clad woodcutter strives to live in harmony with the forest creatures. As the chill of winter grows ever harsh, only time will tell which of their strategies will allow them to prosper.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
