  "synopsis": "When a gust of wind blows away a young woman's hat, a high school girl sprints past her and leaps into the air to retrieve it. However, this is no ordinary girl. Feeling the hat barely escape her grasp, the girl morphs her body into a fighter jet, blasting off into the distance with a burst of speed to catch it. This encounter is the young woman's unexpected introduction to the Henkei Shoujo: seemingly normal girls with incredible transformation powers who live among humans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
