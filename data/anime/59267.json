Children are treated as national treasures and are cared for and protected by adults in boarding schools. Santa Claus, who gives children hope and dreams, is considered a dangerous person and is targeted for elimination. On a snowy December 25th, middle school student Sanda Kazushige's life is threatened by his classmate Shiori Fuyumura. Having learned that Sanda is a descendant of Santa Claus, she is hoping that he will grant her a wish. \"Santa, please find my friend.\" Fuyumura's wish is to find her missing best friend, Ichie Ono. To protect the children, Sanda decides to become Santa Claus and fight against adults!\n\n(Source: Official YouTube, translated)",
