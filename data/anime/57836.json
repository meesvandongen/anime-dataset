  "synopsis": "In an ancient world where gods, demons, and mortals coexisted, the immortal Chang'er and his apprentice Xiao Liang lived in seclusion in the Floating Light Cave. Their peaceful life was shattered by the pursuing demon king Dapeng. The timid Xiao Liang was forced to team up with the clever and cunning scholar Jiang Cheng and the resolute and stubborn monk Chongming, embarking on a journey to find the legendary immortal's abode, Cloud Dwelling. Along the way, the three would face numerous hardships, experience heart-fluttering romance, and endure trials of friendship and life-or-death situations. Meanwhile, a grand conspiracy involving forces from all three realms was unfolding around them.\n\n(Source: iQIYI, translated)",
