  "synopsis": "Toast in mouth and backpack in hand, a pink-haired girl rushes out of her house in haste. However, one wrong step sends her flying across town—back to where she started—and she finds that the day has turned into night. Undisturbed, she continues her sprint only to repeat the same scenario. Only this time, she unexpectedly transfers to a vastly different world. Caught in an endless loop across space and time, the girl calmly navigates through new worlds, each more outlandish and vivid than the last.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
