  "synopsis": "Masaki's career on NewTube ends abruptly when the Harikiri Sisters decide to kick her out of their group during a livestream. With her bad reputation, Masaki has a slim chance of returning to popularity with a solo channel and she is plagued by comments of hate.\n\nMasaki soon meets Live, a vampire who just woke up from her slumber in which she dreamed of Masaki and developed an obsession with her. Believing this discovery will be the next internet sensation, Masaki forms a pact with Live: in exchange for Masaki's blood, Live will help her reach the milestone of a million subscribers.\n\nNow, with the other vampires in Live's house on board with Masaki's ambitious plan, she and Live work together to film videos and restore her to career glory.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
