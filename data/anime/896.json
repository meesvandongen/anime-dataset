  "synopsis": "A mysterious device crashes on planet Earth, causing a wildfire near where Gohan Son, Kuririn, Bulma, and Oolong are camping. Unable to fully save the forest, they decide to use the Dragon Balls to restore it to its previous condition. A few days later, a group of unknown warriors plant a seed where the mysterious device had crashed, sprouting a colossal tree that destroys the forest and neighboring cities in the process.\n\nNorth Kaio contacts Gokuu Son and tells him that this tree is the \"Shinseiju\"—a tree that absorbs all the nutrients in the planet and leaves it a barren wasteland, all the while growing a mighty fruit capable of providing incredible power to anyone who eats it. After learning of this, Gokuu and his friends try destroying the tree before it is too late, but that may prove to be more difficult than they had previously imagined.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
