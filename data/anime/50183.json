  "synopsis": "Ever since a fateful encounter with jazz music, Dai Miyamoto has dreamed of becoming the world's best jazz saxophonist. After only three years of playing the instrument, he makes the bold decision to move to Tokyo in order to break into the music scene.\n\nWhen he meets pianist Yukinori Sawabe at a small music club, Dai believes that he has found a kindred spirit he can form a band with. However, the classically trained Yukinori is reluctant to accept someone who makes such bold claims with so little experience under his belt. Yet, when he hears Dai's undeniable skill, Yukinori is forced to accept the offer.\n\nAlong with the even less experienced Shunji Tamada, the trio form JASS, a group with a unique sound that might just be able to shake up the stagnating jazz scene.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
