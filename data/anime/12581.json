  "synopsis": "After working hard for a scholarship, honor student Yuuki Kagami secures a spot in the prestigious Houren Academy. However, his plans are thrown into disarray when he is assigned to live in a girls' dormitory due to a mistake his teacher, Ayana Kakinozaka, made. To further complicate matters, Yuuki and Ayana are assigned as roommates, and Yuuki will be expelled immediately if other students find out his real gender.\n\nUtilizing his feminine appearance and name, Yuuki dresses up as a girl to avoid expulsion. He must keep his secret safe with Ayana—who seems to take the plan too seriously, putting the two in many uneasy situations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
