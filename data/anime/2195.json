  "synopsis": "Once again have a prescription for lust! In NAUGHTY NURSES, Aoshima General Hospital is well known for its sexy staff that fulfill their patients' every need!\n\nNimura and Mayu are having major relationship problems. Too nervous to have sex with Mayu, Nimura decides that it'll be better if they just break up. But while they might want to go their own separate ways, fate has its own plans for the two of them. Both Nimura and Mayu end up working at Aoshima General Hospital! While having to work together might be uncomfortable for them, it's also stirring up a lot of gossip among the hospital's staff.\n\nBut the gossip isn't really having much of an impact on either of them since the hospital's sexy staff and horny patients are keeping them on call night and day! The young nurse Satsuki taunts Nimura relentlessly with her hot body… the voluptuous head-nurse Ryoko seems to have her mind set on landing him in bed... not to mention that the patients can't get enough of him! All of this attention is great, but Nimura is still struggling with his feelings for Mayu and seeing her every day is making him more anxious than ever. Will this young couple find a way to patch things up despite all of the sexual distractions?",
