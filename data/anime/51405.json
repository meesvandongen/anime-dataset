  "synopsis": "This season's story takes place at the foot of the Great Wall on the frontier of the King's Continent. To safeguard peace at the border, every character who appears has left their homeland and traveled thousands of miles to this place. Although they are all \"strangers\" on this unfamiliar land, their shared belief gives them a common name—the Great Wall Guards.\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",
