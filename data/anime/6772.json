  "synopsis": "Rygart Arrow is different compared to the other people in the continent of Cruzon: he is unable to control quartz, branded an \"un-sorcerer.\" Despite this, he still befriends the future king and queen of Krisna—Hodr and Sigyn—as well as Zess, the younger brother of the Athens Commonwealth's Secretary of War.\n\nSeveral years later, Rygart discovers that there is a war brewing between Krisna and Athens. While visiting Binonten, the capital city of Krisna, he learns that his misfortune as an un-sorcerer enables him to pilot an ancient Golem, a unique ability that quartz-wielding users lack.\n\nAs Zess leads one of the Athenian strikes upon the capital, Rygart joins the battle with his newfound power in hopes of mending the schism between the two nations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
