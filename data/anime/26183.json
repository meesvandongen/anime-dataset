  "synopsis": "Sonsaku Hakufu along with Shokatsuryou Koumei, Chouhi Ekitoku, and Ryuubi Gentoku are investigating Magatama-related incidents that occurred in the last week. Apparently warriors coming from the west are involved, and the defeated all bore the markings of a sword brim on their bodies. Kan'u Unchou, a special A-rank, set out to investigate the enemies, but supposedly loses to them. Ekitoku suspects Kansai has people that are S-ranks, since this is the only way such a defeat could be explained. They then all plan to meet up with Chouun Shiryuu and Kan at a nearby temple, to ensure that there are no more victims, but things are starting to look very grim...\n\n(Source: foo2)",
