  "synopsis": "\"Huey\" Anthony Disward and Dalian trek to the land owned by Sergeant Callavos, where it is rumored that a Phantom Book may be located. With the help of a local herbalist named Thalia, the two reach a remote village and begin to confirm relevant information to their investigation. Although it has been reported that Callavos perished alongside his family in a gruesome fire six months prior, his daughter Florence has been sighted in a nearby forest—and is suspected of causing the blaze. To verify these allegations once and for all, Huey and Dalian travel to the lord's manor, only to uncover the truth behind a thorny past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
