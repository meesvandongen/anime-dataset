  "synopsis": "In the Disabled Elderly Village, there live nine elderly people with unpredictable origins and the young man Qin Mu they raised. One day, the cows that Qin Mu was responsible for grazing began to speak human words. From then on, Qin Mu became more aware of the dangers and beauty of Daxu, a land abandoned by gods: demons descended with darkness, divine bones danced in the ruins, and dragon bones protected their young, a giant ship that drags the sun... No matter what kind of danger he faces, Qin Mu is fearless. He has integrated the skills passed down by the Nine Elders and vowed to carve out a world with his unparalleled hegemony. \n\n(Source: Bilibili, Google translated)",
