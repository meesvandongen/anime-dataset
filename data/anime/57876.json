  "synopsis": "Under the tutelage of the great demon warlock Romberg, Ike grew up with knowledge regarding an ancient advanced civilization that once ruled the land. Coupled with his innate talent in magical arts, this upbringing allows Ike to quickly rise in the Demon Lord's army ranks, leading his brigade to consecutive victories against humans.\n\nHowever, Ike has a secret—he is a human himself. Despite knowing all too well the consequences if this information is ever to leak, Ike is willing to face such immense danger to achieve his goal: find a way for humans and demons to coexist and stop the war that has been carried on for far too long.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
