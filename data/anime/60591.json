  "synopsis": "Orphaned at birth and bullied at work, Myohee has been through countless trials in life. But when she gets scammed by her only friend and ends up bankrupt, Myohee feels as though she'll never find the silver lining to her cloud. She decides to end her own life by jumping from a building, but mid-air, the grim reaper halts her descent, saying her time isn't up yet. She's ordered to live for 100 more days...as a cat! Before she knows it, she's taken to the home of her handsome, aloof boss, Mr. Cha. It seems like the perfect chance to receive the love and care she never had in life...if only Myohee can remain a cat!\n\n(Source: Lezhin Entertainment)",
