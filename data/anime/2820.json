They accidentally activated the Tondekeman, a funny talking kettle who transported them many centuries in the past. \n\nIn Baghdad, Hayato and Yumi gets reunited but they got separated from Tondekeman. They meet Aladdin, Prince Dandarn and Princess Shalala. They also meet the cunning Abdullah who is always ready to kidnap the princess so that he could marry the princess to his master. \n\nOur heroes get to go to different places and times and meet several historical and literary figures as they follow Abdullah as he escapes through time to abduct the princess. \n\nHayato and Yumi are stuck in the past until they get Tondekeman from the possession of Abdullah. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
