  "synopsis": "Ever since Rakurou \"Sunraku\" Hizutome started to play the extremely popular virtual reality game Shangri-La Frontier, he has truly fallen in love with it. Sunraku has quickly made a big name for himself by fighting two of the seven unique, nearly unbeatable monsters, which is unthinkable for most players. To progress the game's story, he sets out on an adventure with his leporine guide, Emul, to acquire a magic operation unit from an ancient workshop.\n\nThough Sunraku breezes through this quest alongside his clanmates Towa \"Arthur Pencilgon\" Amane and Kei \"OiKatzo\" Uomi, there seems to be an ulterior motive as to why the two of them decided to help Sunraku in the first place. Nevertheless, Sunraku gains valuable knowledge and allies, critical for his advancement in the game. By seeking out powerful enemies and unraveling the inner workings of the game's world, Sunraku may just change Shangri-La Frontier forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
