  "synopsis": "The waves of the sea gently ebb and flow, while the mountains silently observe the passing of time. The short life of a bee and the long transformation of continents, both are merely illusions. The flow of time shines eternally in each fleeting moment. Perhaps there are neither beginnings nor ends, nor haste nor delay, not even existence or cessation, in its true essence.\n\n(Source: Vimeo)",
