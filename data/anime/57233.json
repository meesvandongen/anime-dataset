  "synopsis": "\"Capsules Project\" is one of Bilibili's support programs for original Chinese animators. It involves professional teams from various industries with mature animation production experience creating independent short films, regardless of format or style. This is an exploration of original Chinese animation, with each work representing a creative leap forward. The second season expands the audience's imagination of domestic animation by utilizing the characteristics of short films, including science fiction films exploring technological awareness, coming-of-age films focusing on female self-expression and reconciliation, and films showing humanistic care for disadvantaged groups. The art styles encompass traditional Chinese ink painting, Ghibli-style picture books, and retro styles with high contrast in black and white.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
