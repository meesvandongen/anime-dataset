He Fangzhi and Zhou Luobin overcome numerous obstacles, and the truth behind He Fangzhi's old case and the martial world grudges with He Fangzhi's master in Sichuan, the \"Knife Demon,\" are gradually revealed. \n\nIn each bloody battle, the martial world and the imperial court, choices and perseverance, ideals and conspiracies—the martial world map of Zhen Dao Ge will slowly unfold.\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",
