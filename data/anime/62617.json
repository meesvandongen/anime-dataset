  "synopsis": "The sorcerer Luck believes this to be the end. Besieged by powerful demons, he makes the noble sacrifice of holding back their onslaught while his friends escape. Never sleeping or resting, Luck endures the clash of swords, rain of blood, and never-ending stream of enemies. Against all odds, he vanquishes the commander and emerges victorious, only to find that 10 whole years have passed in the meantime. Furthermore, his body has regressed in age to the point where he looks like a mere teenager.\n\nFollowing his triumph, Luck soon reunites with his friends, the hero Eric Imgard Mendirival and warrior Goran Morton. As they believed Luck to be dead, the pair made sure he went down in history as a hero and prepared to quell the rise of the demons themselves, unaware of Luck's feat. With all this in mind, Luck just wants a laid-back life, so he applies as a novice adventurer under the name Lock and sets out on a journey alongside brand new companions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
