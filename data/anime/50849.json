  "synopsis": "At the beginning of chaos, the world was divided into three realms: the realm of deities, the realm of men, and the realm of demons. The realm of deities sent a spirit seed down into the world to help the common people. But the spirit seed continuously absorbed the evil of the world and cruelly harmed living things. In the end, Sen Luo, the king of the deities, sacrificed himself and sealed it. However, because of it, the Shangqing Xianmen, where the realm of deities is located, gradually waned and was lost in history. A thousand years later, the ruins of Shangqing Xianmen started to appear in succession. All major sects fought their hardest for possession of the treasures in the ruins.\n\n(Source: Narul Donghua)",
