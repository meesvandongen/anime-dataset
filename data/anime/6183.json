  "synopsis": "A simple world of sound and picture, composed by NAKAI Yuu from the paintings of major Japanese artist YOH Shomei and pure, simple sounds, comes out in Ga-nime. Great pictures that will make you feel the life of the earth, with the horizon stretching ever farther… Get inside a minimalist world modeled before your eyes, with the sounds of wind and rain, of air and thunder that stir emotions in every viewer’s heart, through a lyricism that resounds at the core of your mind. \n\n(Source: Toei-Anim.co.jp) ",
