  "synopsis": "While exploring Wiz's magic shop with his party, Kazuma Satou finds a magical wish-granting choker and decides to try it on. Only then does Wiz tell him that the choker strangles its wearer to death in four days unless their desires are fulfilled. This wouldn't be a problem if Kazuma knew what his wish was. Fearing for Kazuma's life, Aqua, Megumin, and Lalatina Ford \"Darkness\" Dustiness all agree to do his bidding in order to satisfy his desires and hopefully grant his wish, no matter what he asks for.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
