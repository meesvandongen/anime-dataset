  "synopsis": "Volume #1: A Taste of Honey (Eps #1-3)\n\nAlthough she tries hard, lovely office worker Moe bungles her assignments more often than not. She'd fare better if she spent more time working and less time playing with the office equipment, but it wouldn't be near as much fun. Nana's so cute in her maid's outfit that it's easy to see why everyone wants a piece of her. And while domineering Mai is used to being the boss, she's going to discover the joys of humiliation. A taste will only leave you wanting more, so obey your sweet tooth.\n\nVolume #2: Heat Wave (Eps #4-6)\n\nSayaka is trying to be a prim and proper teacher, but every time she steps in front of a classroom she gets hot... And turning up the air conditioner isn't going bring her temperature down one bit. Misuzu may be a world-class swimmer, but the cold water in the practice pool only heats things up. She's one bathing beauty who doesn't need a sauna to make things steamy. The heat index will soar as these two lovely ladies do their best to set the screen on fire.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
