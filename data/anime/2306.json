  "synopsis": "It consists of two parts:\n\n1. \"The Storm-Calling School Festival\" - Char and Haman host a festival to celebrate the union between the Nu School for Boys and the Zeta School for Girls. But all hell breaks loose when the Counterattack School gang - led by Amuro, Judau and Kamille - rush in to crash the party.\n\n2. \"The Tale of the SD Warring States: The Chapter of the Violent Final Sky Castle\" -  Set in the fictional land of Ark, SD Sengokuden re-imagines the mobile suits and mobile armors of the existing and more serious Gundam stories as super deformed sentient samurai in a setting reminiscent of ancient Japan.\n\n(Source: Gundam Wiki)",
