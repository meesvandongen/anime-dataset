  "synopsis": "While Team Spica's horse girls have accumulated countless victories and raised their popularity, the popular trio known as BNW has been struggling to produce results lately. Consisting of Biwa Hayahide, Narita Taishin, and Winning Ticket, the trio is well-known for their camaraderie during their fierce races, but recently something has distanced them from each other.\n\nWhen Tracen Academy plans to set up a relay race with each of the BNW members leading a team against each other as part of their fan festival, Team Spica's is saddled with the job to convince the team leaders to participate. Although recruiting each of them proves difficult, Team Spica's horse girls are determined to make sure the trio mends their relationship and that the race will be remembered for years to come.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
