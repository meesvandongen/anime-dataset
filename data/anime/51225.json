Channel's \"Paka Live TV Vol.14 1st Anniversary Special!\" stream, a special animation was shown commemorating the 1st anniversary of the Uma Musume: Pretty Derby mobile game starring Kitasan Black and Satono Diamond.\n\nThe story begins at the entrance ceremony of the Tracen Academy in spring. Kitasan Black, still unaware of her dream, begins to pursue her aspirations with a clean slate, while Satono Diamond attempts to win the GI to fulfill her family's long-cherished wish.
