  "synopsis": "The courtyard is awash with cherry blossom petals, appearing especially beautiful in the moonlight. Kagura, waking up, sits in the hallway facing the courtyard, \"The courtyard at night, seems like something can happen anytime......\"\nSuddenly a butterfly glides past, its scales glittering.\nKochou no Sei: That's right. Nighttime is indeed suitable for telling stories.\nKagura grows sleepy under the influence of dust.\nKochou no Sei: After Kagura-sama falls asleep - that will be the beginning of the story in the dream!\n\n(Source: Onmyoji Wiki)",
