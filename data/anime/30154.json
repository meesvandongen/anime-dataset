  "synopsis": "Random ONAs of Kamiusagi Rope. Most are one-shot web collaborations or commercials, these shorts were not included in any DVD release of Kamiusagi Rope hence why they are bundled together for this entry rather than having their own independent entries. If a collaboration has multiple eps (eg. Tire Kan, au, Takarakuji, etc.) it will receive its own entry instead of being included here.",
