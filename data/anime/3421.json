  "synopsis": "The Kodomo No Omocha OVA is a thirty-minute animation video that was made before the TV series. It covers the first volume of the manga, so it's equivalent to TV episodes 1-6. It relates Sana's troubles with Hayama at school as a result of the \"oyakodon baka\" situation and culminates when Hayama's dad and sister realize their mistakes thanks to Sana's efforts. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",
