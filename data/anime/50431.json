  "synopsis": "Chen Jun, an aimless wannabe otaku, suddenly became the Emperor of a multiverse-spanning kingdom. The Empress Sandora, the Empire's 1.2-meter-tall female general Pandora, and the Supernatural Bureau's Big Sis Lin Xue have all said they're not up to the task. Even Chen Jun's childhood sweetheart, the energetic Xu Qianqian, also said he must become the Emperor. Chen Jun did not have a choice and started his busy life by saving the world from Monday to Friday and playing games during the weekends.\n\n(Source: Bilibili)",
