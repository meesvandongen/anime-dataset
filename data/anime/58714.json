Unfortunately, it turns out he's nothing but a measly Talker–a job with no combat skills whatsoever. Undaunted, Noel sets out to establish the strongest clan in all the land, using his silver-tongued Talker skills to unite assassins and heroes under his leadership.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
