  "synopsis": "After succeeding in their winter conflict against Taiju Shiba and his Black Dragons, the Tokyo Manji Gang absorbs their group's remaining members. Due to his heroic courage and indomitable spirit, Takemichi Hanagaki should have accomplished his goal of defeating the tragic fate awaiting his girlfriend, Hinata Tachibana.\n\nIn reality, Takemichi's troubles are far from over. Although Takemichi's actions have exposed Tetta Kisaki's treachery, the conniving schemer has found power elsewhere: Tenjiku, a dangerous gang led by the enigmatic Izana Kurokawa. Izana sets his sights on Manjirou \"Mikey\" Sano, pursuing a vicious interest in the Tokyo Manji Gang's aloof leader.\n\nIn the future, Takemichi discovers that the machinations of Izana and Kisaki led to Mikey's moral ruin—a downfall that directly results in Hinata's death. Unfortunately, a terrible loss robs Takemichi of his time-leaping ability, stranding him in the past with one final chance to rescue everyone he loves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
