  "synopsis": "After Mash Burnedead's clash with Magia Lupus, the secret about his powers is now out in the open. The short-lived celebration ends when the Bureau of Magic summons Mash before an audience of Divine Visionaries, who collectively decree Mash should reap the consequences and die. However, an evil shadow organization called Innocent Zero hijacks the inquiry to demand that Mash be kept alive.\n\nMash proves that he is capable of dealing with Innocent Zero, but the Divine Visionaries' verdict remains unchanged. Luckily, Mash finds unexpected allies in Divine Visionary Rayne Ames and Headmaster Wahlberg Baigan, and they successfully defer his execution until Innocent Zero is defeated. Mash is now allowed to live under one condition: he must be selected as the Divine Visionary candidate by the year's end.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
