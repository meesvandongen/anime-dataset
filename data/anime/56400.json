  "synopsis": "With Rabbi Village greatly expanding under the management of his subordinates Isami Tahara and Yuu Kirino, Hakuto Kunai can now resume his adventures while looking for items to counteract magic. He begins his search at the Prison Labyrinth in Rookie Town, where a secret laboratory deep within the dungeon gives him insight into technology that is far more advanced and dangerous than anything in the rest of the world.\n\nMeanwhile, Rabbi Village has gained unwanted international attention from the newly formed Queendom of Xenobia, which wishes to drive a wedge between the Holy Kingdom of Light and the State of Right. But with Kunai's newly summoned aide, Akane Fujisaki, at his disposal, things may not go as the Queendom plans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
