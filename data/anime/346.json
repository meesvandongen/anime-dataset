However, in the past, a traffic accident deprived him of his parents and his memory. Junna survived the accident, and he has lived only with his sister though he has been looked after by his relatives.\n\nAnd present...\nThe life with Senna in the same high school is so pleasant that he can forget the severe past.

Though he enjoys happy and pleasant days, he is tossed by the past, the present, and the future. What is the truth hidden in his memory?\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
