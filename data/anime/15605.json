Though she's glad she has a new place to call home, the family she gains is greater than she could ever imagineâ€”Ema now has 13 step-brothers!\n\nWishing to give her father space, she moves into the Sunrise Residence where her brothers live. As she settles in, Ema realizes she may not experience the loving kinship of a family that she has always longed for, as many of her new brothers exhibit feelings toward Ema that aren't just familial.\n\nWith each brother desiring Ema's attention in his own way, will she be able to work toward a happy ending for all, or will she choose one brother that has stolen her heart?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
