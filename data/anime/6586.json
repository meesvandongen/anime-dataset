  "synopsis": "Aside from her deep passion for eating cakes, the clumsy Ichigo Amano has never been successful at anything.  After an encounter with Henri Lucas, a famous patissier, Ichigo's amazing tasting abilities—although unbeknownst to her—are discovered.  Recognizing her talent, Henri offers her the chance to attend St. Marie Academy, a prestigious culinary school which specializes in desserts.\n\nIn spite of the fact that she is a beginner lacking skills, thanks to Henri's recommendation, Ichigo is placed in the topmost group with the \"Sweets Princes.\" The princes, famous throughout the school for their magical treats, are Sennosuke Andou, an expert in traditional Japanese sweets; Satsuki Hanabusa, with a flair for candied flowers; and Makoto Kashino, a gifted chocolatier. Ichigo and the Sweets Princes, each accompanied by their \"Sweets Spirits\"—fairies who make patissiers' dreams come true—all work towards their goals in the competitive world of sweets.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
