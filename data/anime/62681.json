  "synopsis": "All things possess a spirit, and the power of nature coalesced into various conscious fairies. However, due to humanity's neglect of nature and the awakening of suppressed powers, the fairies have been harmed. A human girl encounters a fairy from the depths of the water and they have known each other for many years. However, they cannot overcome the barrier between celestial and mortal. On a wondrous journey, the girl resolves to find her own power. She believes that humanity is also part of nature, and that there must be a way for humans and nature to coexist harmoniously. Can she protect nature?\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
