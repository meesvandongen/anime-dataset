  "synopsis": "Musashi Miyamoto is known as a great swordsman of the 17th century. However, while tales of his legendary life loom large, it can be difficult to separate fact from fiction and understand who the man really was. To this end, researcher Kiichi Inukai attempts to investigate and shed light on the subject. From his time as an ordinary soldier, to the development of his unique two-sword style, to his writing of the seminal Book of Five Rings, Miyamoto's life is explored, revealing a picture of the man behind the myth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
