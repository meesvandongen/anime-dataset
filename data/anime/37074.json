  "synopsis": "One of the first Minna no Uta music videos ever created. It follows a child's imagination where \"nobody knows\" the answers to his questions such as what does a star taste like, if he throws his dad's hat really hard into the sky does it become a UFO, when worm wiggles around is it really wiggling into the shape of a number and calculating mathematics, etc.",
