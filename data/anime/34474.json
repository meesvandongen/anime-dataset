  "synopsis": "At the Budokan, an annual event known as the Tsukino Concert puts Tsukino Entertainment Production's best and brightest idol units on the stage. The leaders of idol groups SolidS, SOARA, QUELL, and Growth must compose four unique and distinctive songs for their respective units, which they will perform on the second day of the festival.\n\nComposing four new songs proves to be a difficult task for SolidS's leader, Shiki Takamura, as he struggles to find inspiration. Sora Oohara must learn to overcome past mistakes while propelling his unit, SOARA, to the top. Wanting to escape his past stardom, Shuu Izumi is determined to push his unit, QUELL, up to the level of popularity that his previous one had. Growth finds themselves working together with a rival group, ZIX, prior to their debutâ€”something that leader Kouki Etou is reluctant to do.\n\nTsukipro The Animation tells the stories of these four units simultaneously as they go through their daily lives while preparing for the Tsukino Concert.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
