  "synopsis": "This is a story that weaves together people and a town. A coal mining town crowded with small-scale excavators, commonly known as the \"Hakoniwa.\" In this town that changes daily like a labyrinth, there's a girl named Kagari who runs a mapmaking business and a boy named Yuya who dreams of breaking free from the \"Hakoniwa.\" Eventually, the two, along with the unique residents of the town, find themselves confronting a conspiracy that shakes the entire town. The fate of the” Hakoniwa\" depends on Kagari's drawings on the map.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
