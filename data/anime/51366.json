  "synopsis": "Despite being betrayed by two members of the Four Divine Kings, the army of Kall-Su and Abigail continues its advance against the Metallicana Kingdom with the intent to unleash the god of destruction, Anthrasax. As Gara and Nei Arshes lead a brave counter-offensive against Abigail's innumerable army of undead soldiers, they appear powerless against army commander Lynch, who wields one of the Three Demonic Treasures, Demon-Mail. Meanwhile, Yoko Tia Noto tries to revive the savior of Metallicana, Dark Schneider, in hopes that he will be able to thwart Kall-Su and Abigail's grim plans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
