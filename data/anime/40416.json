  "synopsis": "Soon after falling into another world, Kurumi Tokisaki takes interest in a particular white cat. Much to Kurumi's disappointment, the two part ways.\n\nKurumi later meets Hibiki Higoromo, a white haired quasi-spirit. Hibiki explains that they are at the center of a killing game between quasi-spirits. Within the Neighboring World, the spirits compete for a single wish to be granted to the lone survivor of the death-match.\n\nUnderstanding the rules of the game, Kurumi and Hibiki reach a compromise—a temporary alliance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
