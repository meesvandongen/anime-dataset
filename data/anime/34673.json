  "synopsis": "Unreleased episodes of Shin Skyers 5 released to the public nearly five decades later on the HD Remaster DVD-BD Box Set 2. These specials are sometimes noted with 13 episodes, as the first episode of this batch is a colored version of episode 12 from Skyers 5's TV series. No changes were made to the dialogue, story, or animation except for it receiving a color-swap. As such it will not be included in the episode count as Skyers 5's main entry adequately accounts for this episode.",
