  "synopsis": "A father and daughter are on a trip to see a beautiful view of the moon when they encounter an old man. The old man offers them chocolates and recounts his memories of the last summer of World War II. His experiences, both bitter and sweet, speak to universal human nature that transcends the conflict itself—a shared truth within every person, even if they are on opposing sides of a battle.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
