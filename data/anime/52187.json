  "synopsis": "Zhen Ji, who always speaks his mind, was fired from his previous job because of this habit and went for a job interview at a sunny cafe located downstairs in a residential area. There, he met a somewhat eccentric bald boss, a money-grubbing, bespectacled colleague, a simple-minded but kind-hearted burly colleague, and a particularly vengeful Azali. Here, it wasn't just them; there were also some special customers. Everyone was happy and grew together, experiencing various touching and heartwarming everyday stories filled with tears and laughter.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
