  "synopsis": "Upon first seeing Earth from the Azatos Empire's survey ship, Chief Investigator Liza Luna plans to eradicate every lifeform on it immediately, leaving behind only useful resources. While surveying the planet, Liza discovers that human civilization has evolved at a pathetic rate compared to other lifeforms.\n\nLiza makes her way to the surface of the planet to properly inspect and understand its inhabitants. Still convinced that there is nothing beneficial to be found, the investigator makes her way into a cafe to gauge the planet's food culture. Liza walks into a cat cafe, where she meets creatures far cuter than anything else in the galaxy. Motivated by this new discovery, Liza decides to investigate Earth's numerous adorable inhabitants.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
