Taking refuge at Polar Star Dormitory, the chaotic environment she ends up in is a far cry from her usual refined lifestyle. However, with the help of her friends, Erina gradually finds her place among the dormitory's eccentric residents—creating memorable experiences outside the world of cooking along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
