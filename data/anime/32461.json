  "synopsis": "A lone house stands amidst a barren landscape. Here lives a petite pigtailed girl, unfettered by her loneliness. There is rarely anyone for her to meet and interact with, save for the occasional masked visitors from a place unknown. Her only company is the inanimate objects present around her. They tell tales about themselves, the girl, and the unchanging surroundings they view day in and day out—all the while, she remains oblivious to their sentience.\n\nOne day, the monotony is broken when the girl meets someone who offers her a choice capable of altering many fates, including her own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
