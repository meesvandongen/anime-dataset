  "synopsis": "In folklore, there are many tales about people being deceived by cunning and mischievous foxes. But what if those are humans who simply attribute these traits to foxes and look upon them with suspicion?\n\nOne winter day, Shirou and his little sister Kanko go out to play in the fields and meet a fox cub named Konzaburou. Despite the initial mistrust towards him due to foxes' reputation as tricksters, the siblings not only befriend Konzaburou but also accept his invitation to visit the evening performance that foxes arrange in the forest. Now, what lays ahead for the children is an amazing experience that may forever change their opinion of these animals.\n\nA short film based on a story by Japanese writer Miyazawa Kenji.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
