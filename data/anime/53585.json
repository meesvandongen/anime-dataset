  "synopsis": "Though her high school days are long behind her, Tamami Sakurai is still just as awkward and clumsy as ever. At night, she is often seen at a local Tokyo bar, which has become a safe haven from her stressful job. After a few too many drinks, Tamami begins to feel as if she is invincible, but the hangover afterward begs to differ.\n\nOne such night ends on a disparate note when an intoxicated Tamami hears some familiar chords playing on the record player, bringing tears to her eyes as she recalls bygone years. The melody reminds her of a shy pianist named Rin Kajitani—a boy who was once the closest friend she ever had.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
