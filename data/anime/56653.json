  "synopsis": "The day Sakiko Togawa's privileged life crumbled, she painfully broke her vow to CRYCHIC and left the band behindâ€”an act that tore her heart in two. As days fade into nights, she struggles to make ends meet until a certain cherished memory is tainted, pushing her to the edge.\n\nDriven by a fractured sense of purpose and the need to reclaim what she lost, Sakiko forms Ave Mujica, a masked symphonic metal band. Its members are bound not by a shared goal but by the fragile threads of their divergent desires. Together, they weave a haunting masquerade of loss and rebirth, captivating audiences with a gothic musical stage play. But as the girls' ideals collide, the scars of their pasts rear their ugly heads. The brittle facade the girls have built threatens to collapse beneath them, bringing Sakiko to the verge of falling apart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
