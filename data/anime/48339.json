One year later, Edgar discovers that four of the dinos have been living in the museum basement and have taught themselves kung fu. They befriend Edgar and the group now work together to foil the plans of the other two dinos, raptor brothers evil Skor and dimwitted Skrap, who hunt for crystals that contain mutant DNA with which Skor can create monstrous dinosaurs to conquer the world.\n\n(Source: TVTropes)",
