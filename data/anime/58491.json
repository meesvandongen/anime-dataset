  "synopsis": "Back in elementary school, Etsuko Murakami thought that she was special due to her speed. As other people eventually passed her in athleticism, she grew dissatisfied and gave up running. Now a second-year in high school, Etsuko becomes even more discouraged when the rowing club she joined disbands. However, when passionate transfer student Riina Takahashi insists that Etsuko and their classmate Hime Saeki help her revive the club, things begin to change.\n\nNot long after, the new squad is completed by rivals Taeko Hyoudou and Mayumi Imoto. Even though she is reluctant to try her best at first, Etsuko might have found the place where she belongs as she gives rowing her all alongside the other girls.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
