  "synopsis": "Flower, a local game design studio, finds itself on the verge of shutting down. After its first release turned out to be a complete letdown, the studio is now struggling to make ends meet. The employees of this all-female company desperately need additional hands to help them finish a new project on time.\n \nTomoya Mochizuki's passion is erotic games, or \"erogames.\" He can neither write scenarios nor program, and his artistic skills are quite frankly terrible. However, owing to his massive experience in the field, Nene Sonono—Flower's director—decides to hire him as a consultant.\n \nThe first thing Tomoya points out is that Flower's employees have no sexual experience; thus, their scenarios and sex scenes lack in-depth and firsthand expertise. Eager to learn and develop their professional skills, the girls embark on a crash course to grasp the essence of erogames. Under the attentive eye of Tomoya, they explore previously uncharted waters of sexual pleasure—all for the sake of the company's survival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
