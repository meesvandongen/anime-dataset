  "synopsis": "Yang Chen, the grandson of the Patriarch of the Yang Mansion, was ridiculed by the people in the mansion because he had not awakened his Dao Soul for a long time. In desperation, he breaks through himself to awaken the Dao Soul and Qi Ling Huangyu, and realizes that the crowd headed by his uncle is forcing Grandpa to give up the position of Patriarch. Afterwards, Yang Chen decided to improve his strength to protect his family, and went to Youyun Mountain alone to find medicine. In the end, everyone's conspiracy was broken and the position of Patriarch was kept.\n\n(Source: Youku)",
