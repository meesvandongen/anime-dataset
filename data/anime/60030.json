  "synopsis": "\"I\" dug a hole in the garden and noticed a faint glow on the wall of the hole. Wondering what it could be, I gently touched the wall, and where I touched it, the boundary between the layers of rock lifted up! Behind it was a \"fragment\" of something that emitted light... As soon as I grabbed the fragment, I was pulled by a strong force and fell into a crack in the earth's layers...\n\n(Source: NHK, translated)",
