  "synopsis": "Akino has finally gotten her dream job as a concierge at the fabulous Hokkyoku department store. The expansive store provides a luxury retail experience to customers of all shapes, sizes, and even species! In fact, Hokkyoku is proud to be the only store capable of serving Very Important Animals (VIAs)—extinct species that have managed to find their way to the retailer.\n\nAkino's job as a concierge is to make sure that every customer has a smooth and enjoyable visit. However, with customers requesting discontinued products and needing help with marriage proposals, she has her work cut out for her. If she wants to impress her new boss, she will have to work hard and be more than a little imaginative in her solutions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
