  "synopsis": "With Aria Company closed for the day and her friends attending to other matters, Akari Mizunashi seizes this rare opportunity to go on a casual outing around Neo-Venezia with President Aria Pokoteng. Although her Prima Undine gondola training has taken her to many remarkable tourist spots, Akari finds greater exhilaration reveling in the ordinary sights and sounds of the town. As Akari and President Aria stroll through Neo-Venezia on their own exciting itinerary, some familiar faces are not far behind. Drawn into their private tour, they too may discover a new perspective of the city.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
