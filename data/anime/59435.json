  "synopsis": "Amidst a blizzard caused by UMA Winter, Billy receives a report on the Autumn battle and learns Undead and Unluck are evolving. Juiz appears, revealing to him that the artifacts are weapons meant to defeat God and that the Ark can only perform one more loop. She urges Billy to join forces once more and stake everything on Unluck to achieve their shared goal: \"defeat God.\" However, Billy declares that they cannot work together. Juiz realizes Billy's true intention—to obtain Ark and Apocalypse—but before she can act, Billy drags them into a brutal clash involving UMAs on both sides. Resolute in their own \"justice,\" Juiz presses forward with her blade, while Billy counters by utilizing other Negators' abilities and his pistol. What is Billy's true objective? Meanwhile, Andy and Fuko, having captured Autumn's core, are en route by air to take down Summer. But Billy anticipates that Juiz entrusted Apocalypse to Andy, and sends assassins to strike the pair from the skies!\n\n(Source: TMS, edited)",
