  "synopsis": "Set five years and six months after Condom Battler Gorou and has a much more somber and realistic style. Although the shorts are presented in digest form, they are drawn from a hypothetical 5-6 hour long classic anime that doesn't actually exist. The new series comments on the legacy of the old-school Condom Battler Goro, as the protagonist struggles with the realities of adulthood and the feeling of being a \"has-been.\"\n\nThe series is split into two one-minute parts: The first has the theme \"It's wrong to think that it's embarrassing to wear a condom.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the theme of the second part is \"It's a big problem to not be able to say 'Wear a condom.'\"\n\n(Source: ANN)",
