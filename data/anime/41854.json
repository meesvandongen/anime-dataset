  "synopsis": "For her sake, he would sacrifice anything...\n\nWhile volunteering in Nepal, a Korean medical student named Sangmin Han encounters the beautiful yet tragic Sita. Previously, she was a Kumari—a prepubescent girl worshipped as the vessel of a goddess. But she has since been forsaken as a Kumari, and cast out from society. Falling in love, they marry and move to Korea, but their blissful love is short-lived; Sita dies only a year later.\n\nLosing the woman dearest to him, Sangmin desperately begs the gods to bring Sita back. His prayers are answered but in exchange for a sacrifice, and he awakens in the streets of Nepal. However, something is amiss—his body has suddenly aged, and standing in front of him is a young Sita, with no memory of him.\n\nThrough two lovers bound together by a destiny running deeper than it first appears, For the Sake of Sita is the story of Sita growing up as a Kumari, and Sangmin's tribulations in trying to avert her terrible fate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
