  "synopsis": "Four years after the original Kabi Usagi shorts, a new episode was released. This was longer than the original, contained smoother animation, was fully voiced (unlike the original which has no voice acting), and numbered as \"story 01.\" A series/additional numbered shorts were expected under this franchise revival but it never came to fruition after this first episode.",
