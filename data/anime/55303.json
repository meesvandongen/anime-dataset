  "synopsis": "Year 7380 Star Calendar, Jingliu, the mara-stricken swordmaster of the Luofu, slashed her way out of Starskiff Haven, cutting through the Cloud Knights tasked to subdue her before vanishing in the mist of history.\n\nYear 8096 Star Calendar, a young soldier named Yanqing rose to fame from the tournament hosted by the Seat of Divine Foresight, and was conferred the rank of Cloud Knight Lieutenant.\n\n\"The years pass in a flash, cups of wine the only solace.\"\n\nA fleeting flash — thus is the speed of swift blades as the master and her student spar, and thus is the passage of the unceasing torrent of time.\n\nJust how long has it been?\n\nHis duel with his master, centuries ago, still rippled like a memory from yesterday.\n\nBut the few years between now and when he took in the boy as his student felt like a lifetime.\n\nTime gallops, swift as a stallion, sudden as a lightning strike, agonizing as a blade that runs him through. And yet, it feels like everything has always been the same.\n\n(Source: YouTube)",
