  "synopsis": "Baja is a little hamster that lives in an animation studio. During the day, the studio staff fawn over him as they take a much-needed break from their busy production schedule. By night, however, Baja is all alone—except for the ever-present duck floating in the pond outside his window. One night, when the duck is suddenly threatened, Baja desperately wants to do something to save it. With the power of the animation studio on his side, Baja steps into a magical world where anything seems possible.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
