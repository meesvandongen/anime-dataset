  "synopsis": "The story still goes on. This narrative described the experiences of Tao Yao, Mo Ya, and Childe Liu during their tour in JingShi. It suggested that the gaps between people and between people and fairies might not be as great as people thought. Whether it was through Tao Yao's relationship with Ding Sansi, Old Zhang's advice to Childe Liu regarding life mistakes and cooking techniques, or Mo Ya's predicament when confronted by Xi Nang, these experiences allowed each of them to mature. Concurrently, Feng Wule, Chen Baishui, and additional individuals also achieved their personal atonement. It's possible that everyone has an impact on one another throughout life's path, in all of its flavors.\n\n(Source: Bilibili)",
