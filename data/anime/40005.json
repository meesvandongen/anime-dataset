  "synopsis": "The Black Order returns and decides to make its move against Mo Fan during the assessment for advancing to the main campus. To counteract them, Mo Fan trains using the Three Step Pagoda. Later, he is selected to be an exchange student at another university. The exchange program curriculum includes a team fight and a practical test, of which the latter takes place in a city filled with monsters. During all this, the deserters from the defense force put Mo Fan in a predicament, adding to the existing obstacles to his dream of becoming the strongest mage.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
