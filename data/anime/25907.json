  "synopsis": "Dual and Dorothy, faithful computer antivirus programs, monitor and constantly scan for corruptions in the simulated worlds of the Box of Wisdom. Whenever a virus is detected, it—and in many cases the entire world as well—is forcibly purged. This routine occurs every day without change, until the deletion of a particularly large virus cluster reveals an unknown program—calling herself Remo—with no memory of her function. She offers a fresh perspective into the monotony of Dual and Dorothy's lives as her influence causes the two programs to realize that there is more to life than just their mission.\n\nNo longer spending their time only watching over the worlds, the three girls start truly experiencing them. As they explore digitally recreated cities and landscapes, Dual and Dorothy develop a special appreciation for what they have, all while searching for clues regarding Remo's forgotten purpose.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
