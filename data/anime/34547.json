  "synopsis": "Mahmut Tuğrul is the youngest Pasha in the Türkiye Stratocracy, a title granted to members of the Divan—the council that governs the nation. Haunted by witnessing the loss of his mother and village during the war 12 years ago, he has dedicated his life to serving his country and preventing further bloodshed.\n\nYears after the devastating clash between the aggressive Balt-Rhein Empire and Türkiye, tensions flare once more. Political unrest brews along the border of the two countries as rival factions and skirmishes push both nations closer to all-out conflict, threatening their fragile peace.\n\nAs turmoil grows, Mahmut's idealism and inexperience as a leader is called into question and he is stripped of his rank. However, this setback brings about unexpected allies in the fight against the Empire. As war looms over the continent, Mahmut must navigate a web of political intrigue and dangerous battles, fighting to protect the peace he holds dear and prove himself a capable leader.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
