  "synopsis": "Jiu Yue is a nine-tailed fox spirit who is more than two centuries old. She faces her hardest challenge yet: trying to adapt to the modern world. Knowing she needs money to survive, she starts working at a company—only to realize her coworkers are just as mythical as her! As Jiu Yue and her new friends attempt to fit in, their non-human sides make even the most trivial situations take a ridiculous turn.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
