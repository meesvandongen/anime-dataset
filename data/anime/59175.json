Using his connections, Tonbo's mentor Kazuyoshi Igarashi is able to convince coach Hajime Udou to train her. While Tonbo initially has trouble showing off her abilities with her peculiar playstyle and inexperience with using a variety of golf clubs, she quickly proves her worth at her course debut by making use of her unique skills.\n\nLeaving an impression on Hajime and the people around her, Tonbo is sent to compete in the Kyushu Women's Championship. Met with familiar faces and new rivals, she is determined to dive deeper into the professional world of golf.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
