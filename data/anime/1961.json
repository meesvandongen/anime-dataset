  "synopsis": "When a sudden thunderstorm strikes, Mei, a young goat, has no choice but to take shelter in an abandoned barn. Before long, he is joined by another animal—a wolf named Gabu. The night is pitch black, and neither of them can make out the other's appearance, but they become fast friends as they chat for hours, promising to meet again.\n\nAs soon as Mei and Gabu reunite in daylight, they are met with a predicament: they would normally regard each other as mere predator and prey. However, they vow to remain friends nonetheless and start meeting in secret. While their friendship deepens, their families find out about it, forcing both Mei and Gabu to wonder if their relationship is truly worth the risk.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
