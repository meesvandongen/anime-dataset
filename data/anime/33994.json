  "synopsis": "Sleepy Life of SERVAMP\nWhen they are not busy battling supernatural threats, servamps and their Eves enjoy carefree day-to-day affairs and lighthearted quarrels. Naturally, while other servamps and Eves work through their own troubles, Kuro plays video games and dozes off—not much of a change from his usual sleepy self. \n\nHai ni Mamireta Shoukei: All the world's a stage\nDuring a fight, Hyde recalls the time he used his charm as a hedgehog to trick Licht Jekylland Todoroki—piano prodigy and self-proclaimed angel—into forming a blood bond and becoming his Eve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
