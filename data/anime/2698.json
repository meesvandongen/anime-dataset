  "synopsis": "One day, high school friends Akira Houjou and Chiaki Asami flip a coin and make a vow that completely changes their fates. For his part, Akira immediately drops out of school to join the yakuza, while Chiaki toughs it out in order to become a politician's aide. Although they seem to have made polar opposite choices, the two friends feel as if they are two sides of the same coin; they will do whatever it takes to reform Japanese society as they see fit.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
