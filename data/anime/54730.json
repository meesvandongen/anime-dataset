  "synopsis": "Following an epic series of fierce fights between various factions of Choujin—beings blessed with supernatural physical abilities that hail from all corners of the galaxy—the former enemies of Seigi Choujin, the victorious group, negotiate a fragile ceasefire. However, peace is short-lived, and a group of seven Perfect Choujin—led by Strong the Budo and called the Perfect Large Numbers—invade Japan, defeating several Seigi Choujin and burning the peace treaty.\n\nDetermined to protect peace at all costs, Terryman, the current leader of the Seigi Choujin, challenges the seven Perfect Large Numbers in a tournament for supremacy. Although the odds are not in his favor, Terryman knows that he can count on the top Seigi Choujin, Suguru Kinnikuman, to see justice prevail.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
