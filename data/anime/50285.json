  "synopsis": "Set in 2014, the anime follows the adventures of 23 years old Mafuneko, a newly minted assistant director who joins the TV production department at Tokyo Hajikko Television, only to discover that the glamorous and glitzy life of working behind-the-scenes making TV shows involves strange and inexplicable tasks such as \"gathering 300 acorns\" and \"making a mosaic out of the images reflected in the camera lens.\" Despite being surrounded by chaos, set-backs, and weirdos, Mafuneko struggles to become a fully-fledged TV producer.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll, edited)",
