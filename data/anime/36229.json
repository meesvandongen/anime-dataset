  "synopsis": "These are six loosely-related anime/live-action music videos from the band Hi-Fi Set. For the most part, they form a story about the love life of two cute dragons who live in a high-tech future city. This disc was released in 1985, right in the middle of Hi-Fi Set's career (1974-1994), and features songs from that era (from their 1984 and 1985 albums Pasadena Park and Indigo).\n\n(Source: Piyo-Piyo Productions)",
