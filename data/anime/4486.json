Dr. Saotome's fears are justified when the militaristic Hyakki (or \"Hundred demons\") Empire appears, but Dr. Saotome is prepared with the creation of an even more powerful Getter Robo, Getter Robo G and a new Getter Robo base. Also with Musashi Tomoe dead, Dr. Saotome needs a third pilot which he finds in baseball player Benkei Kuruma.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\n",
