Takashi and his classmates have never encountered anyone quite like Taro before. He is blue, has huge glowing eyes, pointy ears, a smooth bald head and one horn. Takashi, obsessed with trying to figure out this strange new visitor, attempts to track Tarou's every move; and in the process he continuously falls victim to Tarou's hilarious assortment of cosmic jokes and traps.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
