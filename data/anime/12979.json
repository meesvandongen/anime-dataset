  "synopsis": "The competitive shinobi world has proven to be challenging for Rock Lee, who lacks the typically required abilities. To compensate for this handicap, the young ninja tenaciously endures severe training to hone his hand-to-hand combat skills. Whenever necessary, he also resorts to creative fighting techniques. With the constant support of his teammates Neji Hyuuga and Tenten, Lee readily embraces daring adventures as opportunities to advance on his path toward excellence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
