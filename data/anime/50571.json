  "synopsis": "Because of a mistake in the summoning process, 30-year-old social animal Liu Yinuo was accidentally summoned into the game world. In order to return to reality as soon as possible, Liu Yinuo began to assist the 18-year-old \"brave\" Tian Enya to save the world. With her excellent cognition, Yinuo, who was originally a high-player, was like a duck to water in another world. Enya also grew from a wayward little girl to a mature and reliable big girl.\n\n(Source: bilibili, translated)",
