  "synopsis": "Takato Saijou and Junta Azumaya—Japan's sexiest men—perform wonders together as co-stars. Their next joint assignment is to act in a play featuring a flamenco showdown, but Junta once again holds an advantage due to his ancestry and because Takato has never danced before. Fueled by his ceaseless desire to outshine Junta, Takato decides to travel to southern Spain and learn firsthand the passion needed to perform the demanding dance.\n\nIn the warm and friendly Spanish streets, Takato meets a wonderful flamenco dancer, an older handsome gentleman by the name of Ceres. Although Takato wishes to learn from him, his plans are soon interrupted by Junta's arrival in the area to visit his grandfather's hometown. Now, aside from struggling to reach Junta's skill level, Takato must also deal with Junta's family and face off against Antonio—an unexpected rival for Junta's love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
