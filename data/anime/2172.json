  "synopsis": "A slapstick comedy on a bomb uproar, and a touching story about the ties between the Nohara Family and their dog Shiro. A film in the musical style including the scenes with inserted songs. When the Nohara Family enjoy a trip to Okinawa, a strange object like a flying saucer becomes stuck with Shiro's bottom. That is a special bomb dropped by \"The Only Buttocks Aliens,\" and it has the power to destroy the whole earth. The space monitoring center \"UNTI\" (Unidentified Nature Team Inspection) begins to pick up the bomb, but a female terrorist group \"Hinageshi Opera Company\" tries to get the bomb and disturbs UNTI's work.\n\n(Source: Manabu Tsuribe)",
