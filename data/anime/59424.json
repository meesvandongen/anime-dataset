  "synopsis": "As a white mage, Lloyd is constantly looked down on by the hero party's arrogant leader, Allen, who eventually expels him on a whim. Despite being the former student of a legendary mage, Lloyd wanders the city helplessly for days, unable to find a new party in need of a supporting member.\n\nHowever, Lloyd's fate takes an unexpected turn when Yui, the leader of a S-rank group of adventurers, pleads with him to join her party on a mission dear to Yui's heart. Although Lloyd keeps downplaying his abilities, he eventually accepts Yui's aggressive offer. Warmly welcomed by his new allies, Lloyd may have just found the perfect place where his magical prowess will be rightfully valued.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
