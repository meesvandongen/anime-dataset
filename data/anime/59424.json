  "synopsis": "Lloyd, a white mage trained by Lady Merlin herself, is a member of the illustrious Hero's Party—until they kick him out for being \"too weak,\" that is. What the Hero's Party doesn't know, however, is that he's actually crazy strong! No longer shackled to the party that never understood his worth, Lloyd is quickly Scooped Up by an S-Rank Adventurer who immediately recognizes his talent and invites him to join her party.\n\nTogether, Lloyd and his new comrades set off on a quest to hunt a pack of high wolves, but they soon discover that there's much more to this simple job than what meets the eye...\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",
