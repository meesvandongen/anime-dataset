  "synopsis": "With her late grandfather's inspiring words in mind, Chizuru Mizuhara teams up with her friend Kazuya Kinoshita to launch a crowdfunding campaign for an amateur film. The two hope that with the success of the project, Chizuru can honor her grandparents' wishes before she loses her grandmother as well. After their wild encounters with three girls—Kazuya's clingy \"trial\" girlfriend, Ruka Sarashina; their nosy new next-door neighbor, Mini Yaemori; and Chizuru's shy work friend, Sumi Sakurasawa—they all collaborate together to reach the campaign goal and begin production of the film. As their ambitious endeavor progresses, Chizuru and Kazuya grow closer and begin to struggle with their mutual feelings.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
