  "synopsis": "Tokyo is the home of national-level horse girls and the next generation of running prodigies. Jou Kitahara, a rookie trainer with big dreams and modest expectations, does not expect to find talent in the quiet town of Kasamatsu—until he meets an ash-gray-haired girl with a wild, unconventional stride.\n\nAs a child with bad knees, Oguri Cap spent much of her early life in pain, struggling to stand. But through relentless perseverance, she overcame her limits and found liberation in the very thing that once seemed impossible: running. While the other horse girls at Kasamatsu chase victory and fame, Oguri runs without ambition, driven only by the joy of movement.\n\nFujimasa March, a rising regional star, commands attention with her discipline, talent, and tenacity. For her, running is a matter of pride. But when a school-organized race brings her face-to-face with Oguri's raw, unpolished stride, March's confidence begins to waver. In turn, something in Oguri shifts after racing March. For the first time, a spark of ambition ignites within her—a desire to win that will take her beyond the confines of her hometown to the grand stages waiting on the horizon.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
