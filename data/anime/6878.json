  "synopsis": "Usavich (ウサビッチ) (from Japanese うさぎ \"usagi\", rabbit, with \"vich\" giving it faux Russian flavor) is a series of animated short films being produced for MTV Japan by Kanaban Graphics. It's about an odd couple of rabbits imprisoned in a Russian prison. While the first season (1-13 eps) shows the absurd everyday occurrences of the two rabbits' prison life, the second season (14-26 eps) tells the adventures of their escape and life on the run.\n\n(Source: AnimeDB)",
