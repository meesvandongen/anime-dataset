  "synopsis": "The story takes place in a universe where countless parallel universes known exist. There is always a link — called \"Prism\" — connecting the modern world and these parallel worlds, and sometimes energy and substance comes through. One day, monsters known as \"Eight\" come from a parallel world and begin attacking. Humanity begins its counterattack using a power called \"Skuld,\" which harnesses the power of tomorrow. The government gathers Skuld users into an army known as \"Norn,\" but the Eight still wreak destruction over the years. Then, a boy named Asuma who can use an ancient weapon is discovered. \n\n(Source: ANN)",
