  "synopsis": "While on an errand in the forest, retired E-rank adventurer Belgrieve stumbles upon a basket that holds an abandoned baby girl. Taking pity on her, Belgrieve decides to adopt the infant and names her Angeline.\n\nGrowing up, Angeline idolized her father, especially admiring his swordsmanship and wishing to become an adventurer just like Belgrieve once was. To fulfill this ambition, Angeline sets out to the royal capital. Over the years, she rises to S-rank, gaining the title of the Black-Haired Valkyrie. Despite surpassing her father, Angeline boasts about him and embellishes his exploits, generously calling him the Red Ogre.\n\nAt last, the time for Angeline to go back home has come, but she quickly realizes that various evil forces persist in preventing her from returning to her beloved father's side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
