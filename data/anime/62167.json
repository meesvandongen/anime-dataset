  "synopsis": "Dongfang Shaohong, possessing two Dao bodies, but lacking the spiritual roots to awaken his spirit body, is ridiculed by his own clan and even betrayed by his fiancée. Troubles pile up one after another. Dongfang Shaohong's father, imprisoned for possessing the secret to entering the Cangyu Immortal Palace, is trapped by the Immortal Alliance. In the midst of his clan's crisis, Dongfang Shaohong inadvertently uses his own blood to activate the Dao Stone of Immortal Source within him, repelling the Immortal Alliance and saving the clan from the brink. In these dire straits, Dongfang Shaohong is fortunately rescued by his father's friend, Master Ji Yin, and is offered refuge within the Piaomiao Sect. Within the Taiyin Mountain ravine of the Piaomiao Sect, Dongfang Shaohong diligently cultivates, but possessing the Dark Night Dao Body of the Nether Clan is viewed as an anomaly among the human race and constantly harassed by his fellow disciples. Dongfang Shaohong realizes that only by becoming powerful enough can he rescue his father, clear his name, and expose the Immortal Alliance's conspiracy.\n\n(Source: Bangumi, Google translated)",
