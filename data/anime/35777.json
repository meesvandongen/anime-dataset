  "synopsis": "Rilakkuma is a soft toy bear who showed up one day to live with a young woman named Kaoru. It spends its days lounging around the apartment. Although there is a zipper on its back, what is inside is a mystery. Rilakkuma loves pancakes, rice omelets, custard pudding and \"dango\" rice dumplings. Its friends are Kaoru's pet bird Kiiroitori and a small white bear cub named Korilakkuma who also showed up out of the blue.\n\n(Source: Netflix)",
