However, their peaceful days are disrupted by the threatening terrorist organization Amalgam. Leonard Testarossa, a member of the organization who possesses \"Whispered,\" seeks to procure Kaname and her knowledge. \n\nKaname and Sousuke's battle against Amalgam starts right in their own neighborhood, which eventually takes them on a hunt around the world.
