  "synopsis": "A-gata-kun, B-gata-kun, O-gata-kun, and AB-gata-kun are back again to explore more cultural stereotypes associated with blood type! With assistance from their feminine counterparts, the blood types delve into a range of topics related to relationships, such as one's own charms, how to react to a mediocre gift, and... How to properly hide adult content on a computer? Whether they are stranded on an uninhabited island or sharing a dorm room together, no two blood types will react the same way to any of these humorous yet relatable situations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
