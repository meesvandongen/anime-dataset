  "synopsis": "High school student Haruno Shiozaki and her friends live in a remote mountain town where the only thing worth looking forward to is turning 16 years old—the legal age required to obtain a motorcycle license. However, when Haruno's family hires Cynthia B. Rogers to work at their inn during the peak season, excitement buzzes around the new visitor. As Haruno's friends are charmed by the foreigner's loud and brassy attitude, Haruno wonders whether people from a town as small as theirs are able to have dreams too.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
