  "synopsis": "A boy resurrected from the Cemetery of Gods and Demons searches for the truth behind the fall of gods and demons ten thousand years ago in a new continent formed by the collision of East and West. He also seeks the truth about his lover Yu Xin, the whereabouts of his parents, and the reason for his resurrection. All the causes and grievances revolve around the protagonist, ultimately leading to a story of the vast Six Paths and the chessboard of heaven and earth.\n\n(Source: Baidu Baike, translated)",
