Unable to remember who he is, he uses psychic powers to break out and sets out to discover himself, and the truth behind those who are after him - the Galerians. Their mother Dorothy, the super-computer with a God complex, will not sit idly by, as he holds the only key to the program that can destroy her.\n\n[Witten by Ebo]",
