  "synopsis": "As a young child, Takashi Natsume believed his ability to see youkai to be nothing but a curse. Now a high school student, Natsume has managed to heal from his old wounds and form unbreakable bonds with humans and youkai alike. Natsume's newfound friendships—including the one with his spirit bodyguard Madara, nicknamed \"Nyanko-sensei\"—are often interlaced with his duty to return the names of the spirits written inside the Book of Friends, his late grandmother Reiko's keepsake. While more remarkable youkai reach out to him, Natsume discovers that he still has much to learn about the world that surrounds him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
