  "synopsis": "Music video for the song Tonosama Gaeru by 2who'z, with special narration from Japanese actor Kouji Ishizaka, that was featured on NHK's Minna no Uta program. \"Tonosama gaeru\" is the Japanese name for the East Asian true frog species Pelophylax nigromaculatus, which can also be read as \"shogun frog\", hence the caricature. The video was released on a two-disc DVD produced by Pony Canyon under the same name, along with various versions of the song. No additional animation is believed to be on the DVD release.",
