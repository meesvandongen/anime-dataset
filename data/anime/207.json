  "synopsis": "Alongside new and old allies, Parn saves his village from the ruthless attacks of a goblin tribe. Following their victory, Parn, his priest friend Etoh, the elf Deedlit, the dwarf Ghim, and the magician Slayn set out on a journey together to investigate the evil that has started to haunt the island of Lodoss. The party engages suspicious demonic creatures but gets arrested by the soldiers of a fortified city. Although Parn and his friends are quickly released, they cannot stop Ashram—a powerful warrior tasked by the rogue hero Beld to subjugate Lodoss—from conquering the city and murdering its beloved captain.\n\nAshamed by his own weakness, Parn swears an oath to surpass Ashram. However, hiding behind Beld's political ambitions, the witch Karla seems to have set darker plans into motion, and Parn will have to enlist additional help to stop a major catastrophe from destroying Lodoss and everything he holds dear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
