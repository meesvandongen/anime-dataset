  "synopsis": "Nie Feng has a body of true yang, but he came from an ordinary background, has a rough fate, was repeatedly oppressed and calculated, and finally embarked on the road of confronting the eight major sects alone. Unexpectedly, Nie Feng did not die because of this, but was reborn back to his boyhood at the age of seventeen. In this life, although he was from an ordinary background, he possessed peerless martial arts and rose rapidly in the martial arts. The regrets of the previous life will be made up. All enemies will be buried.\n\n(Source: baike.baidu)",
