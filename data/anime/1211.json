  "synopsis": "Several decades after the First Space War, humans and Zentradi have established peace, spreading human culture across the galaxy. Young pilot Isamu Alva Dyson is excited to work on United Nations Spacy's next-generation fighter, which is being developed on his home planet, Eden. Moreover, he contends with his old classmate and romantic rival Guld Goa Bowman, who is participating in the development project as well.\n\nWhile Isamu and Guld continue to clash, the extremely popular AI idol Sharon Apple is hosting a concert and is managed by none other than the pair's mutual old flame, Myung Fang Long. As old emotions get dredged up, they jeopardize what all three of them have worked to create.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
