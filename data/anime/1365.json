  "synopsis": "The latest innovation in virtual reality gaming is set for a private showcase, with the children of Japan's elite given the opportunity to playtest it. Unfortunately, their carefree fun is cut short when a company employee is found murdered, his dying message pointing to a clue hidden within the game's historical setting.\n\nAlong with the Detective Boys and Ran Mouri, Conan Edogawa enters the game to solve this mystery and ensure the perpetrator is caught. But once they load in, an artificial intelligence named Noah's Ark imprisons them and the other children within. To escape and bring the murderer to justice, Conan and company must navigate a simulated 19th-century London and track down the infamous Jack the Ripper—with the lives of 50 innocent children depending on them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
