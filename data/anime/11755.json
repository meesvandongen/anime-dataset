Decades later, the nine cyborgs seem to be untouched by time, but they live in a world where \"justice\" has as many nuances as the number of people living on the planet. What is their place in the world now? \n\n\"In the beginning was the Voice, and the word was Him; and all obeyed His word in great awe.

Scattering across the land and laying it to waste, man turned a deaf ear to His Voice.
