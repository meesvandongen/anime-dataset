  "synopsis": "The Red Ranger, Tougo Asagaki, finds himself transported to another world in the middle of a fierce battle against forces of evil. Upon arriving, he quickly makes a name for himself as an adventurer and takes on a job from a young mage named Yihdra Arvoln. With his eccentric powers and frenzied personality, Tougo blazes through the mission with her.\n\nAfter the quest, Tougo and Yihdra begin adventuring together with their respective goals. Tougo strives to help as many as possible in the new world and find a way back home, while Yihdra desires to redeem her family lineage of mages and make magic accessible to everyone. Along their journey, the duo discover the limitations yet endless potential of the bonds they forge as they overcome adversities to achieve their aspirations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
