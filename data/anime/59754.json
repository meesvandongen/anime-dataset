  "synopsis": "Informed by his relationships with Inuit friends and 20 years of mostly solo expeditions, Yasunaga Ogita pens a poetic account of a walk in the Arctic. He observes animals in their natural habitat, and falls asleep with a sense of oneness with nature mediated by the wind. Then when the new dawn arrives with energy for the world, he sets off walking again. An essay in the back of the book discusses the seriousness of climate change.\n\n(Source: Kodansha)",
