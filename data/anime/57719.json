  "synopsis": "Although Kenzaburou Tondabayashi is a 52-year-old bureaucrat, he is well versed in reincarnation stories where a protagonist suddenly awakens in a fantasy world. After being hit by a truck, Kenzaburou lands in that exact situation. However, what baffles him is the fact he wound up in the world of an otome game—as the young villainess and the daughter of a duke, Grace Auvergne.\n\nFortunately for Kenzaburou, he is somewhat familiar with his new world, as it is based on the game called Magical Academy: Love & Beast. He was a proud father in his previous life, and he often listened to his daughter rave about the game's setting and characters. Armed with background knowledge and a lifetime's worth of dad skills, Kenzaburou strives to make the most of his new life, though his kind-hearted nature makes it difficult to fully embrace the role of a villainess.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
