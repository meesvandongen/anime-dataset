  "synopsis": "A promotional video for Chinka, a proposed anime series from Danny Choo's Studio Mirai production studio. Announced in 2010, the series never came to fruition. Choo describes the story as follows:\n\nSince a few years ago, there have been many cases of arson.\nIn the rural town of Kiyotaki, situated in a beautiful mountain valley, the town folks are talking about the legendary arsonist, Akaneko [赤猫].\n\nThe police have completely given up on Akaneko, who has slipped through their fingers every time.\n\nThe town's only hope is its one and only firefighting team—the Mizuneko [水猫] Fire Brigade. But because of their destructive fire fighting ways, they too are feared by the town folk. Almost every night, Akaneko and the Mizuneko Fire Brigade fight fiercely, taking down many of the town's buildings in the process. The Mizuneko Fire Brigade have depleted most of the town's financial resources so the town ends up on the verge of bankruptcy. The town was in a critical state when Chinka, a girl with a superhuman ability to smell out fires appears. With her powers, the Mizuneko Fire Brigade close in on the true identity of Akaneko...\n\n(Source: ANN, paraphrased)",
