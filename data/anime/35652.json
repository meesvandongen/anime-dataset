  "synopsis": "A small country town. Recently, the town has witnessed many strange incidents. A youkai kindergartner O-o-o no Shinnosuke (an apparent homage to the classic supernatural franchise Gegege no Kitarou) and his youkai father Tamatama Dad arrive in town. They are said to be looking for the yokai Big Butt Mom who has run away from home. When an elementary school girl Fumie Sakura is suddenly attacked by the mysterious Fuzzy Wuzzy, a superfluous-hair youkai, Shinnosuke goes to her aid. Their encounter is the start of the greatest youkai case in the small town's history. \n\n(Source: Amazon)",
