  "synopsis": "Spring is coming and the all-male Kanenone Gakuen prepares to become coeducational with the new academic year. Naturally, the teenage boys are more than thrilled at the prospect of having adolescent girls around. With only a few months until the merger, the incoming female students decide to pay a visit to the academy. As luck would have it, Yusuke Takasaki gets a chance to confess his feelings to one of the arrivals, Futaba Kutsuki, who is also looking forward to the encounter.\n\nHowever, as the pair struggles to find a moment for themselves, a girl called Midori Chitose visits them in their dreams, urging them to do their best and encouraging them to seize the opportunity. From then on, the lovers decide to make the most of their short time together before they are separated again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
