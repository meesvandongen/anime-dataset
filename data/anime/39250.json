  "synopsis": "Sumikko Gurashi debuted in 2012 as slightly negative characters who like to stay in the corner of a room. The characters include \"Shirokuma,\" a polar bear who is sensitive to cold; \"Penguin?\" (with a question mark in its name), a penguin who is unsure if it is actually a penguin; \"Tonkatsu,\" a piece of pork cutlet that was left uneaten; \"Neko,\" a shy cat; and \"Tokage,\" who hides his nature as one of the last dinosaurs.\n\nThe franchise has inspired toys, books, stationery material, video games--and now a feature film.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
