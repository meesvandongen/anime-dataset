  "synopsis": "Shout and Crunchy are \"trash throw away-ers\" who work in the dead of night. Makina is a 16-year-old witch who has come to the world of humans and to London to study for one year about how to become a proper bride. But Makina searches for Shout and Crunchy, and begs them to throw away her \"Witch's Book.\" Truthfully, Makina wants to quit being a witch and become a normal girl, and the book is just a hindrance. But the book is not something one can simply just throw away.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
