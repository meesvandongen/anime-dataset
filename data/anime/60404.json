  "synopsis": "After receiving an invitation from Princess Doremi to the Christmas concert on Doremifa Island, Anpanman and his friends immediately set off for Doremifa Island. They decide to sing Christmas songs together by ringing the beautiful bell fruits that Princess Doremi has collected. However, Baikinman appears there dressed as Santa. Baikinman releases sticky buns from his crackers, which soil Doremifa Island, the musical instrument buns, and Anpanman and his friends. Will Christmas be without songs like this? Go for it, Anpanman!\n\n(Source: Amazon, translated)",
