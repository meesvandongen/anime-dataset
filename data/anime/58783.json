  "synopsis": "Eunkyum has been at his company for a year now. He is friendly, bright, and has a great relationship with his colleagues. But he is unlucky in love—most likely because he is a sucker for looks. That is why he was thrilled when his hot new boss joined the company... before he made Eunkyum's life hell.\n\n(Source: Manta Comics, edited)",
