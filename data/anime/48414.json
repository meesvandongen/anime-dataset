  "synopsis": "An apocalyptic event has ravaged Japan, leaving nothing but endless sandy plains behind, and a strange rusting disease terrorizes the remnants of civilization. According to the government, the horrific state of the new world is the result of mushroom spores being spread by the likes of Bisco Akaboshi, labeled the \"Man-Eating Mushroom.\"\n\nBut Bisco would beg to differ. In reality, he is a \"Mushroom Protector,\" determined to uncover the legendary \"Sabikui\" mushroom—said to be the ultimate cure for the rusting disease. Joining him on his quest are his giant crab Akutagawa and the kind doctor Milo Nekoyanagi, who is actively searching for a rust poisoning treatment for his sick sister. Despite the prejudice aimed toward him by the common folk, Bisco refuses to give up on his quest to purify the rotting world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
