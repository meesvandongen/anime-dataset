  "synopsis": "In Tokyo Fire Department's Fire Academy, a talented new rookie is excelling in the strict and grueling rescue training. With high proficiency in both physical and mental categories, Daigo Toake is envied by one of his peers, Shun Onoda. Despite feeling a growing sense of rivalry, Shun recognizes that a part of his jealousy stems from his admiration for Daigo, and that they will eventually work together for the same noble goal of rescuing people.\n\nAt the same time, Yuki Nakamura is the only woman among the current batch of recruits. She believes that she will not be outclassed in this male-dominated profession. As the fates of the three newbies intertwine, they may soon realize that the intensity of a real disaster is nowhere near what they have experienced in training. Even so, the heroes in orange will always shine brighter than any fire, saving those in need.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
