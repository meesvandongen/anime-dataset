  "synopsis": "It has been months since Hayato Kasukabe decided to save his late grandmother's cafe, Familia Café Terrace, from permanently closing its doors. He and the five \"goddesses\" who serve as the cafe's mascots—Ouka Makuzawa, Akane Hououji, Riho Tsukishima, Shiragiku Ono, and Ami Tsuruga—persevere through all the hardships of maintaining a business to stay afloat for as long as possible.\n\nRougher times await them when a new competitor cafe, Family, appears with the sole intent of bringing Familia down. To come out on top of this business competition, Hayato must use his wits, fortify his trust in the girls, and figure out how to entice customers to continue supporting Familia.\n\nTo further complicate matters, the girls slowly begin to develop feelings for Hayato, causing tensions within the group. As this can potentially pose an even greater threat to Familia's survival, the five goddesses need to find a way to compromise and unite at all costs.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
