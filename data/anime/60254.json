  "synopsis": "For as long as he can remember, the klutzy Tsuyoshi Yano has been prone to injury. Constantly showing up to school with fresh scrapes and bruises, he has long become accustomed to the pain and to the sight of his face covered in bandages. However, Yano's days begin to change for the better when he is transferred to a new class and meets Kiyoko Yoshida, the class president known for her reliability and kindheartedness.\n\nThrough Yoshida's efforts to learn more about him, Yano starts to experience the kind of high school life he has always wished for—one filled with laughter and camaraderie. Between casual conversations and countless small accidents, the two gradually grow closer, and their relationship may bloom into something more than just friendship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
