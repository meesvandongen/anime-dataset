  "synopsis": "Ever since horse girl Oguri Cap left the small town of Kasamatsu to chase greater heights in Tokyo, she has rapidly gained attention with her remarkable results. Her goal to become the best horse girl in Japan seems within reach, but there is a rival in her way—another running prodigy named Tamamo Cross.\n\nHowever, Tamamo is not the only threat to Oguri: several world-class racers from overseas are joining the Japan Cup, pushing the renowned race's competition to unprecedented levels. With the support from the people close to her and her intense desire to win, Oguri will do anything to conquer the Japan Cup and continue sprinting for the top.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
