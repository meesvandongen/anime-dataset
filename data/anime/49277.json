  "synopsis": "As the Hidden Tree, which protected heaven and earth and the three races, began to decline, Bi Han, burdened with her divinely ordained identity and mission, embarked on this long journey. To find the Primordial Chaos and restore peace to the world, she faced countless hardships and dangers along the way. There was the warmth of her closest relatives and the obstacles of the most wicked and dangerous, but fortunately, she had companions by her side. Although the journey was arduous, she still sang as she went.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
