  "synopsis": "Recounting the historic meeting of two of series creator Leiji Matsumoto's most striking heroines, Maetel and Emeraldas. Maetel is the black-clad traveling companion of the young hero, Tetsuro, while Emeraldas is a dashing pirate queen more familiar to fans of the \"Captain Harlock\" series. Here the two are seen in flashback, squaring off for a fencing match, Maetel in her long black coat, boots and fur cap and Emeraldas in her red jacket, red cloak and boots and white pants, both with long, flowing blond hair. The bulk of the story-line focuses on what happens when Emeraldas' ship forces the Galaxy Express to a stop on a remote planet and takes Maetel and Tetsuro prisoner.\n\n(Source: IMDb)",
