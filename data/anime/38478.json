  "synopsis": "The 2nd season of Caribadix had the characters in band practice climbing up to a band release. At the precipice of episode 26 we finally see a break in their career and in episode 27 a glimpse of the performance. Afterwards a full music video was released, almost 3 times the length of a normal Caribadix episode. Here they perform a cover of Renai Revolution 21, the eleventh single of J-pop idol group Morning Musume.",
