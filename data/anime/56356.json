  "synopsis": "There is PawPaw School, where various clubs gather. Among them, 'Hero Circle' has special kids with superpowers. Teo, a naughty head of the club, has telekinesis. Vincent, a timid vampire, can transform into a bat. Sena, who is cynical and competitive, has a speed of light. Lucky is an angel who is always bright. Dino is a scientist who transforms into a dinosaur when he's angry.\nThese five kids claim to be the problem solvers at school, but they often ruin things even more because they are impatient and clumsy. However, in order to become a hero who fights against real villains someday, Hero Circle continues to search for accidents in school, today as well.\n\n(Source: Official Website, translated)",
