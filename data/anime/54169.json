  "synopsis": "Armored tank. A walking combat vehicle equipped with a complex running device called \"lifting legs.\"\n\nAlthough it has high rough terrain running performance, it cannot match combat vehicles of the same scale in terms of armor firepower due to structural limitations.\nKuwai Valley, announcing the arrival of Senunkyu. Captain Sudo, commander of the Independent Legged Tank Company, was tasked with destroying an enemy tank that had turned into a pillbox. A roar with legs is now roaring across the deep mountain cliffs!\n\n(Source: Official Website, translated)",
