  "synopsis": "In Beijing, a city full of opportunities and pressures where modernity and traditional culture echo each other, the small pavilion located in a quiet alley at the foot of the CBD is the gathering place where various elements collide and ferment. It has no eye-catching signs and luxurious decoration, making it easy to overlook it when passing by. But familiar guests know that in this small warm space, you can unload the fatigue of the day and enjoy a comfortable time. As a result, there are many dusty stories in everyone's heart quietly flowing out.",
