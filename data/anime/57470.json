In a world where a pandemic has rendered all men impotent, high school student Itsuki is the sole exception. In order to protect this secret, he transfers to a very special high school, which turns out to be composed 90% of girls!\n\nThere, he encounters an upbeat and friendly senior, a sexually frustrated female teacher, a tomboyish school \"prince,\" and an heiress from a wealthy family. For Itsuki, who has his pick of any woman in the world, the question remains: which one will he choose?\n\n(Source: Official site, edited)",
