  "synopsis": "Tragically perishing from overwork, a young Japanese woman is reborn as Dahliya Rossetti, daughter of a newly entitled baron. Her father, Carlo, is a beloved magic artificer, a maker of magical tools. Inspired by him, Dahliya uses her memories from her previous life to create practical inventions and become a magic artificer like Carlo.\n\nA few years later, the now adult Dahliya has made a name for herself and has gotten engaged to her father's apprentice. However, her life takes a turn for the worse when Carlo suddenly passes away and her fiancé leaves her for another woman not long after. Although having to fend for herself, Dahliya is not quite ready to give up on her dream of becoming a master artificer yet. She may be a single woman but, with the help from old and new allies, she is prepared to overcome any obstacle in her way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
