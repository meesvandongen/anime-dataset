  "synopsis": "From a young age, Kurumi Mirai has aspired to become a magician. Driven by her ambition, she has spent her childhood preparing to join the prestigious Rettoran Academy of Magic. Although Kurumi excels in the selection exam, her dream is crushed when she is not chosen for the elite magic class.\n\nAdmitted to the standard class at the academy instead, Kurumi soon befriends Maki Kumiiru, her new roommate; and Yuzu Edel, another girl unhappy with her placement. However, to everyone's surprise, their homeroom teacher, Minami Suzuki, promises to teach the class magic anyway. Although skeptical at first, the girls start to believe that this may be their second chance at realizing their dreams and becoming wonderful magicians.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
