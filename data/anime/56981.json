  "synopsis": "In the desolate wasteland of the apocalypse, during the third year of Emperor Shizong's reign, the world was in chaos, and the people suffered greatly. Demonic sects and evil factions lurked in the shadows, wreaking havoc, and factions fought amongst themselves, creating utter chaos. Amidst this turmoil, various sects and factions emerged, vying for resources and territory, and striving to establish their own independent rule. Some ambitious individuals sought to conquer the world and establish dynasties, while others, driven by righteousness, aimed to save the common people. Wei He, possessing a Breakthrough Pearl that could allow him to break through realms, traversed this chaotic world, step by step forging his own legend.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
