  "synopsis": "In the warring states era, there were those who performed feats resembling demons or gods—though that is now a thing of the past. The Lord now lives in a completely declined and impoverished tenement. The Lord who has fallen into such circumstances, encounters a single dog. Feeling pity for its peculiar short-limbed appearance, the Lord reaches out a hand, but soon becomes amused by its mischievous behaviors. Thus begins the cohabitation of the fearsome Lord and cheerful dog, bringing peace and harmony to their lives!\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
