  "synopsis": "Ren Nanahoshi has been chasing a certain thrill he once experienced at a live festival when he was a child. Now, as a first-year university student, he avoids making friends and practices singing by himself, hoping to find that adrenaline once more. A fateful encounter at a karaoke bar allows Nanahoshi to meet Yuuto Goryou and Wataru Matoba—both of whom are impressed by his voice. The two have been searching for band members, and they want Nanahoshi to be their vocalist.  \n\nNanahoshi initially rejects their constant pestering but relents after attending their live show and performing alongside them. Joined by the carefree Rio Kikyou and passionate Banri Shiroishi, the five boys form \"Argonavis\" and set their sights on headlining the Destiny Rock Festival. As they begin to work together as a band, they come across the trials and tribulations that come with pursuing stardom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
