  "synopsis": "Psycho divers are people who, through technology, are able to enter an individual’s psyche where they can directly address any psychological issues. Due to his reputation as one of the most skilled divers, Busujima is hired to remedy popular musician Yuki Kano's bouts of psychosis that prevent her from singing. However, when he learns that a previous diver has died trying to help Yuki, and that her mental condition has a strange connection to a religious cult, Busujima wonders if he will be able to make it out of her mind alive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
