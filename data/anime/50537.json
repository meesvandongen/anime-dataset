  "synopsis": "This story told the experience between Tao Yao, Mo Ya and Childe Liu's tour in JingShi, which showed that the distance between human and human, human and fairy may not be as insurmountable as imagined. Whether the interaction between Tao Yao and Ding Sansi, or the guidance the Old Zhang told to Childe Liu about life-overstep and cooking skills, or the dilemma when Mo Ya faced Xi Nang, these let each of them acquire new growth. Meanwhile, Feng Wule, Chen Baishui and others also obtained their own redemption. It may be that the journey of life is influenced by each other in this way with all of its flavors.\n\n(Source: Bilibili)",
