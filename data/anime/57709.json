  "synopsis": "The title is a portmanteau on kudomono (fruit) and nou (brains). The anime consists of three two-minutes skits, with basically the same structure. Orange and Pineapple are in Hong Kong, Ancient Egypt, Outer Space. Orange is trying to accomplish something - watching a drug deal go down, taking a break from work, trying to defuse a bomb outside a space station - while Pineapple pesters him with pointless and increasingly obscure questions. Eventually, Orange goes ballistic, calling Pineapple a \"fruit brain.\". They both peel down their skins to expose their brains and launch into a dance number with the locals - the subjects of the stakeout, Egyptian laborers and gods, astronauts and aliens. Orange`s task is forgotten, with the expected results. Stir and repeat.\n\n(Source: Orphan Fansubs)",
