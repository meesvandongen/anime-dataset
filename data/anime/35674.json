  "synopsis": "70 million years ago dinosaurs ruled the Korean Peninsula the same way they ruled the rest of the earth. At that time the part of the land now known as Jeonnam Yeosu was the forest habitat of numerous dinosaur species: Tarbosaurus. The youngest of a family of Tarbosaurs, Spotty is a curious and playful child. Along with his mother and siblings, he lives happily in the forest, waiting patiently to learn to hunt. When that day arrives, it marks the beginning of a long and painful journey into adulthood for Spotty. The cunning One-eye, an older Tyrannosaur looking for a new home, attacks Spotty's herd one day and, smelling sure victory, viciously tears Spotty's family away from him. Now on his own, he meets up with another lonely, lost Tarbosaur. Blue Eyes becomes his constant companion for two decades and the mother of his own children. But fate is fickle and Spotty's troubles with One-eye are not over, and revenge, death, fear, and sadness are all in Spotty's future - as is happiness and hope.\n\n(Source: IMDB)",
