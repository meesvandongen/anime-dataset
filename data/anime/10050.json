  "synopsis": "Sheryl Nome, the acclaimed Galactic Fairy, views herself first and foremost as a singer—existing solely to be an instrument of her melody and rhythm. Ranka Lee, on the other hand, finds herself inadvertently reborn as the Super-Dimension Cinderella through her energetic singing. Driven by their shared passion for song and drawn together by their love for a pilot, the two songstresses from Macross F meet once again in Macross F Music Clip Shuu: Nyankuri to deliver an original animated collection of music videos and character clips.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
