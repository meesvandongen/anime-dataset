  "synopsis": "The New Year has finally arrived for the Seishun Academy Boys' Tennis Team. As part of the festivities, Ryouma Echizen and his fellow first-year club members—Satoshi Horio, Kachirou Katou, and Katsuo Mizuno—celebrate by reminiscing about the past year. As the freshmen revel in nostalgia, it seems as if a strange hanetsuki tournament has begun among the rest of the team.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
