  "synopsis": "No matter how hard Chu Sangwoo tries to resist it, every part of his body wants to grab onto Jang Jaeyoung and never let go. With the spontaneous Jaeyoung by his side, Sangwoo learns that breaking free from his routine and acting on impulse is not always a bad thing. Perhaps submitting to his true feelings will bring him even closer to Jaeyoung, more than he could ever imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
