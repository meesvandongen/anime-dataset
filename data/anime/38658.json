  "synopsis": "Winter is frigid and cold, but underneath one's soft futon, there is a haven of warmth. Snuggling in a futon's folds provides incomparable bliss—until morning arrives. Braving the unforgivable chill is necessary to go about life, but one can always remember that, at the end of the day, their futon will be waiting for them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
