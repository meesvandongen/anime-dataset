  "synopsis": "A song originally used in the children's television program Hirake! Ponkikki. The popular CD was originally released in 1975. In 2008, it was released alongside an anime DVD with a music video.\n\nThe song starts by expressing how Taiyaki-kun and other taiyaki pancakes are fed up with being relentlessly cooked up on a hot plate day after day. In the song, Taiyaki-kun escapes to the sea, but ends up being caught and eaten by an angler.\n\n(Source: Pop Matters)",
