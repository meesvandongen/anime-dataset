Sekai and Fumina arrive on the island, only to discover that Gyanko, Shia and Minato were also invited. Yuuma declines the offer as he is assisting Mirai on a photoshoot, only to realize that he and his teammates are on the same island. Meanwhile, the Nielsen Lab experience an anomaly when their new Plavsky particles form a giant crystal and cause Gunpla on the island to go out of control. The Gunpla Fighters must band together to stop the crystal from wreaking havoc on all Gunpla Battle Systems around the world.\n\n(Source: ANN)\n",
