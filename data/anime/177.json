  "synopsis": "Sakura and Syaoran live peaceful lives in the desert country of Clow. Despite the King's disapproval of the budding romance between the princess and her archeologist friend, their days remain blissful if not a little dull. But that soon changes when Sakura appears in front of Syaoran in a trance with wings on her back. When the wings dissolve into feathers and Sakura loses consciousness, Syaoran is spurred to action.\n\nSyaoran soon learns that he must collect Sakura's feathers, which have been scattered across many different realms, in order to protect her life. After making a deal with the Dimensional Witch Yuuko Ichihara, Syaoran teams up with Mokona Modoki, a creature who has the power to traverse realms. Also accompanying him on this journey are Fai D. Flourite, a carefree man fleeing persecution in his home world, and Kurogane, a swordsman forced to travel to refine his strength and character. Together, the bizarre alliance works to reclaim Sakura's feathers—no matter how impossible it seems to find them all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
