  "synopsis": "Despite being the most talented player on the Kamihoshi High School baseball team, Yuuji Yugami is a loner and ostracized by his classmates. Yugami, however, is optimistic and adamant about remaining friendless—which is what he tells new transfer student Chihiro Watanuki.\n\nChihiro, on the other hand, aims to make new friends as quickly as possible. Although initially perplexed by Yugami's enigmatic personality, Chihiro ultimately aspires to better understand him after finding herself on the receiving end of his unexpected kindness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
