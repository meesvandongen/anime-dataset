  "synopsis": "Four slice-of-life omnibus stories.\n\nThe Rain and a Cat, Soda Ice Cream from the Convenience Store One Sunday, Reki, Langa, and Miya head out to the skatepark as usual when a squall suddenly hits them. They head back to Reki's place and start playing Karuta, a Japanese card game they find!?\n\nBecoming Really Serious About Things In the past, Sakurayashiki and Nanjo had spent their high school days in relative obscurity. These two always had butt heads and competed, but what lies ahead for them from all this competition?\n\nMorning Routine This story unravels the mystery surrounding Ainosuke and Kikuchi's everyday life. It closes in on their secret moments, crossovers, and a moment beyond that draws closer.\n\nHiromi, Do Your Best! Shadow is an anti-hero at night, but this is his three-part slice-of-life flash story highlighting his noble and kind personality as he works hard at a flower shop during the day.\n\n(Source: Aniplex USA)",
