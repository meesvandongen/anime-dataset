  "synopsis": "This account summarizes what I experienced between spring and summer of that special year when all human and material activities came to a standstill. I had retreated to my highland forest lodging away from the city, and while I was pent up there avoiding human contact, I chanced upon evidence of mysterious creatures in my yard. So I set up a surveillance camera, which to my surprise captured images of miniature humanlike beings about 15 centimeters tall. I named them \"Pukkulapottas\" and followed their activities daily with my camera, but as spring turned to summer and people began moving about again, I lost my ability to see them. This experience has prompted me to ask the question whether all the truths in this world are confined to what our eyes can see.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",
