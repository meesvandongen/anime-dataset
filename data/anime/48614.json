  "synopsis": "Ai Ooto is finally at the cusp of unraveling the mystery behind her best friend's suicide. After stepping into the strange dreamlike world of the Wonder Egg and sparing people from their adversities, she reaches her end goal of resurrecting her friend from death. Yet, now with her friend alive, Ai is confused and hurt after realizing that she does not remember her anymore.\n\nShe is not the only one who has been alienated by the person she saved. In fact, the other girls caught up in the affairs also face the same repercussions for bringing someone back to life. As they try to grasp their new reality, the girls come to terms with the trauma from their \"mission\" and question whether they should dive back into the Wonder Egg to uncover the truth behind everything.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
