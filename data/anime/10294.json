  "synopsis": "Living amongst the rest of humanity, there is a small number of people known as \"Attractors\" that possess strange powers. Fearful of these dangerous mutations, a highly secretive organization named Custos uses cyborgs from a group called WTOC to exterminate Attractors before they can injure anyone or disrupt the social order.\n\nConversely, inside the theme park Fantasium Garden, there is a hidden group of Attractors who want to save their people from being eradicated by Custos. Led by the ever-optimistic Quon Mitsuchi, the Attractors take on intense fights against Custos's WTOC in the hopes of protecting the existence of their kind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
