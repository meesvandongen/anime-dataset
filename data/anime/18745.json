  "synopsis": "The cultural festival is one of the most important events on the academic calendar. Just like all other clubs, Mizusawa's Karuta Club is preparing to participate as well. Due to previous circumstances, Team Captain Chihaya Ayase is temporarily absent during the team planning. First year student Sumire Hanano is intent on taking advantage of this occasion to fulfill her dream and finally make her teammate, Taichi Mashima, fall in love with her. A play based on Genji Monogatari might be just the thing she needs to enact her plan.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
