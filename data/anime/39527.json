There, he sees Akira Kariya playing rugby, a sport he was once passionate about but gave up due to his physique. While Akira is running roughly, Riku gives him a piece of advice without thinking. From that, Riku feels his dying passion for the sport set ablaze, and his future starts to brighten up...\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
