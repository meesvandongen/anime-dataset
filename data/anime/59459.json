  "synopsis": "In the Kingdom of Ridill lives a genius magician known to be the first person to ever use chantless magic. With this amazing skill, Monica Everett joins the Seven Sages as a hero who can defeat powerful dragons, such as the legendary black dragon, all on her own. However, the truth is that the Silent Witch developed chantless magic due to being too shy—preferring to live on a mountain top, far from society.\n\nHer secluded lifestyle changes, though, when a fellow sage tasks her to covertly defend the second prince, Felix Arc Ridill, from attempts on his life. Unfortunately, that means she will have to go undercover as a student at Serendia Academy. Between guard duty and her social anxiety, Monica is facing her most difficult mission to date.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
