Only the combined forces of Swordsman Zeke, Swordswoman Neris and the psychic Flare stand between the sadistic Glode and his total subjugation of the people of Lyon. In Flare 2, the forest of Lyon becomes host to a malevolent force that consumes all who trespass its borders. When Lady Neris and her brother Eo disappear while investigating, it is up to Flare to discover what new evil lurks in the heart of Lyon! \n\n(Source: AniDB)",
