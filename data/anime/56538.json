  "synopsis": "Summer is in full swing, and so is the love between Sawako Kuronuma and Shouta Kazehaya. From attending summer school together to meeting each other's parents, the two enjoy quality time together while tackling the feelings of self-doubt and emotional strain that come with their newfound love.\n\nMeanwhile, Sawako's close friends, Chizuru Yoshida and Ayane Yano, struggle through their own romantic dilemmas as their past experiences with relationships clash with their present feelings. Full of inner turmoil, the youngsters' desire for intimacy persists through their second year of high school as they weave through the labyrinth of indecision and insecurity that is love. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
