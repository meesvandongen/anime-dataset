  "synopsis": "Ao Suto is a self-confessed otaku. He talks about otaku with her classmates every day, and of course he has never had a girlfriend. Perhaps because he is seen like this, his classmate, Umi Tono calls him Otaku-kun instead of his name and treats him coldly. But he also had a dream. His goal is to find a good partner and start a family. The school also has a club to make dreams come true, a child-making and pregnancy club. The child-making and pregnancy-hunting club is a nationally sanctioned club activity that encourages students to become pregnant and conducts pregnancy-hunting activities. Ao was able to join the club after the selection process. According to his advisor, there is a girl who wants to be Ao's partner. Ao couldn't believe her eyes because the girl who entered the club room was Ukai Tono, who treated Ao coldly.",
