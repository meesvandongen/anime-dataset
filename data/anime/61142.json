  "synopsis": "Seiwa University High School is renowned for its elite athletes and national-level sports teams. Despite not playing any sports himself, Kouyou Kotesashi enters the school hoping to become a sports doctor and accepts a live-in position as a dormitory's caretaker. Upon his arrival, Kotesashi learns that the dorm is also home to five skilled female athletes: Aroma Kusunoki, Miyuki Hongou, Izumi Sumiyoshi, Chiyo Sayamagaoka, and Aoba Kitahara.\n\nAlthough faced with skepticism, Kotesashi quickly proves his worth by using his vast knowledge of the human body and massage techniques. With a single touch, he identifies what is troubling each of the girls and helps them recover properly. When the chairman promises him a scholarship if he takes care of the girls' well-being, Kotesashi is determined to ensure that they stay in top shape.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
