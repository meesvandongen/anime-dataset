  "synopsis": "Abandoned as a child, Zuku has become a brigand to survive. One night after committing a robbery, he is approached by a strange little girl who prompts him to visit the pine grove beach nearby. Upon arriving there, Zuku is surprised to discover an unconscious young woman covered in a sparkling veil. Enticed by its splendid material, he snatches the fabric and attempts to flee. But its owner unexpectedly awakens, begging him to return the precious accessory.\n\nWith no other memory save for the veil's importance, the woman refuses to let Zuku leave without recovering it. Showing no remorse, the bandit violently renounces her plea—but little does he know, this unusual encounter will change his life forever. \n\nInspired by a renowned Japanese legend, Hi no Tori: Hagoromo-hen follows the intertwined fates of two individuals who learn to comfort one another amongst their troubles, illustrating the power of compassion and its ability to transform even the most bitter of hearts. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
