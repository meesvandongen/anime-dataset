  "synopsis": "The distinguished Night Raven College, an all-boys arcane academy, houses its students in dormitories modeled after the historical figures known as the Great Seven. These dorms—Heartslabyul, Savanaclaw, Octavinelle, Scarabia, Pomefiore, Ignihyde, and Diasomnia—are like worlds of their own, each governed by a housewarden who holds near absolute authority. But individuals with power often hide the most severe traumas, and eventually, even those suppressed emotions must overflow.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
