  "synopsis": "Although Hyouma Kunato has begun to feel comfortable around Botan Nagatsuki and her family of tsukumogami—objects possessed by spirits called marebito—he has not forgotten about his main goal in life: revenge.\n\nUnbeknownst to Hyouma, while he is training in Kyoto under the supervision of the Kadomori family, the Bureau of Traditional Music, a group of three musical instrument tsukumogami, begins to enact its plan. The trio questions Botan's family about their intentions regarding Hyouma's presence near the person embodying the frontier between the human and marebito worlds. Soon after, the paper umbrella tsukumogami that Hyouma had been pursuing for years suddenly reappears and abducts Botan along with her university friends. Rushing to save the one he swore to protect, Hyouma might have to change his priorities if he wants to keep his promise to Botan.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
