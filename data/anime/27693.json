  "synopsis": "Sometimes, it is the simplest gestures that convey the most intimate feelings. From awkward first encounters in an elevator to receiving a hand-knit sweater, love can blossom even in the most mundane of situations. Each new experience of sweet—and at times bitter—romance develops in less time than it takes to smoke a cigarette.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
