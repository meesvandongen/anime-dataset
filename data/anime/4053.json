Rikkai is not only seeking revenge for its team's previous loss to Seishun at the Kanto Regional Tournament, but they also are aiming to win the national title for a third consecutive year.\n\nIn the conclusion of Tennis no Oujisama, the titular \"Prince of Tennis\" is pitted against the \"Child of God\" in a head-to-head battle for the national championship title. Along the way, Ryouma must teach his opponents and teammates that there is more to tennis than winning.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
