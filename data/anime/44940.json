  "synopsis": "At the Border Defense Agency's headquarters, the B-Rank Wars are underway as each team fights intensely to secure a spot in the upcoming Away Mission. Though Osamu Mikumo and the rest of Tamakoma-2 have pulled through thus far, the final rounds will require them to push far beyond the limits of their current abilities. Taking in a talented new member, the squad begins to train and develop new strategies, but, amid these efforts, the team is shaken by a heated dispute—one that could jeopardize their ticket to the Neighbor's dimension.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
