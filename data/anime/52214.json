  "synopsis": "As a spirited young girl, Yohane ventured into the big city with ambitious dreams of becoming a star. Two years later, she has yet to pass a single audition. Since Yohane cannot support herself alone, her mother invites her back home to discover something new that only she can do. With limited options and an empty wallet, Yohane reluctantly returns to Numazu, her hometown.\n\nIn the seaside town, Yohane reunites with her canine companion, Lailaps, and slowly settles in, opening a fortune-telling shop. She reconnects with old friends she had forgotten and meets new ones, all of whom help in her search for a unique purpose and meaningful path in life.\n\nUnfortunately, all is not well for Yohane and the people of Numazu: a mysterious power is affecting the town and disrupting nature and wildlife. While forging stronger bonds with her newfound allies, Yohane devotes her summer to finding the magic that may help save Numazu.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
