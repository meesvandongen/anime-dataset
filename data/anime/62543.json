(※Muri ja Nakatta!?)\n\n\"I want to learn to love myself—just the way I am!\"\n\nRenako Amaori, a former gloomy and socially awkward girl, reinvented herself for high school and successfully made her debut. She even managed to join the top-tier popular group... only to be suddenly confessed to by two of its brightest stars?! One is the school's ultimate prince, Mai Ouzuka. The other, the beloved angel of the campus, Ajisai Sena. There's no way she can handle both their affections—no freaking way!\n\nWhile still struggling to give them an answer, Renako agrees to help her friend Kaho by joining a cosplay event. It's the perfect excuse to delay her reply... or so she thought. But as she witnesses Kaho's passion firsthand, something begins to stir inside her.\n\nWhat is it that she truly wants? What is she truly searching for? Can she really not become someone's lover? Or has that \"no freaking way\"... not been so impossible after all? \n\n(Source: REMOW, edited)",
