  "synopsis": "Long ago, harmony across the galaxy was maintained by a sacred star known as the Mother Planet. But that peace was shattered when the Mother mysteriously exploded and vanished without a trace.\n\nIn the aftermath, the galaxy plunged into chaos and conflict. Yet from the scattered remnants of the Mother Planet, new beings were born—sentient fragments known as the Galverse.\n\nNow, these Galverse girls, each imbued with extraordinary powers and an unstoppable gal spirit, rise to confront the evil organization \"Space End Society.\" As they battle across the stars, they begin to uncover the truth behind the galaxy's collapse—and the fate of the Mother Planet itself.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
