  "synopsis": "Even though he is the top salesman at his company, Keiichirou Tachibana decides to quit his job to open a bakery. While looking over résumés for a head patissier, one name sticks out in particular: Yuusuke Ono, the young man who confessed his feelings to Keiichirou in high school—and whom Keiichirou harshly shot down. Now, Yuusuke is known both as a genius patissier for his skills in the kitchen, and for possessing a demonic charm that attracts even straight men into his bedroom.\n\nDespite their shared past, Keiichirou hires Yuusuke and starts working on making the bakery a success. Before long, the pair is joined by former boxer Eiji Kanda, who is searching for a new career after an injury forced him to retire early. Everything is looking up for the newly-opened bakery named Antique—but the ghosts of the employees' pasts threaten to upset their simple lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
