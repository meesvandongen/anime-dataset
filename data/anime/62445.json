  "synopsis": "Xuan Qi, with mediocre talent, was originally just an unranked supernatural being on the list of powerful beings, whose life's ambition was simply to survive to the end in this world, prioritizing safety above all else. However, during an outing, he happened to witness the fierce battle between the Alluring Empress and an ancient demon, becoming an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire. In this critical moment, Xuan Qi unexpectedly activated the \"Heavenly Show\" system, gaining the ability to continuously gain \"Admiration Points\" by displaying the demeanor of a peerless master. Subsequently, Xuan Qi, by sheer chance, was forced to appear as the \"reincarnation of the God Emperor,\" seemingly effortlessly slaying the ancient demon and defeating a series of masters from the Otherworldly Demonic Path. \n\nFrom that moment on, he became famous throughout the land, revered by the entire Great Victory Divine Continent. Even more miraculously, his every word and action was always misunderstood as having profound meaning. Countless supernatural beings regarded him as a god, while the Otherworldly Demonic Path considered him a major threat.  \n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",
