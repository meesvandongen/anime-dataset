  "synopsis": "The storyline is unknown but judging from the sneak peek unveiled at the Ostuni Festival, it focuses on a team of heroes battling evil forces with their Top Plate. These heroes include the protagonist red-haired boy owning Blaze Liger, a gray-haired boy with Mortal Shark, a brown-haired boy wielding Rocky Golem, a blonde-haired girl having Antler Goat and a green-haired boy owning Wings Falcon. The evil forces however consist of the antagonist red-haired boy owning Dread Dragon, another red-haired boy owning Reptile Hydra, a red-haired girl owning Poison Scorpion, a blue-haired boy owning Thunder Wolf and a mysterious man. Another red-haired boy will also appear with an unnamed red Top Plate with additional characters.\n\nThe Top Plates also have a \"spirit\" in the form of an animal relating to its motif appearing during special attacks. These special moves seem to be activated by their owner using an elemental bow and arrow and shooting it to reveal their spirit.\n\n(Source: Top Plate Wikia)",
