After returning to Japan, he becomes the leader of a baseball team of juvenile delinquents and meets his eternal rival, Hyuuma Hoshi. After going to Koshien, the two rivals join Tigers and Giants respectively as professional players. They face-off against each other as they continue to improve their skills, Hyuuma as a pitcher who throws \"Big League\" balls and Hanagata as an aggressive player.\n\n(Source: TMS)",
