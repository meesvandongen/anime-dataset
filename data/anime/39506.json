Some anime-original content will be created as well.\n\nEpisode 1: During their qualification exam in planet Naberius, the player and fellow ARKS trainee Afin were attacked by vile organisms known as Darkers.

The newly-reformed ARKS is tasked to investigate the reason behind it all, and it seems like the truth is more complicated and horrifying than expected... \n\n(Source: phantasystar.fandom.com) ",
