  "synopsis": "Always ready for a fight! Destruction for destruction's sake! The online streamer Aoringo is a troll, making the worst of the worst of boundary-pushing flamebait content and raking in the revenue from the hate-watchers. You may think he's nothing more than a bottom feeder and a drain on society, but in reality, he's high school dropout Soji Enishiro, a caring older brother with a sweet tooth who loves nothing more than his little sister. His viral videos? Just a way to pay his sister's medical bills. And even if all of humanity hates him, he doesn't care, so long as his little sister gets better. But then, something very strange begins to happen...  Don't miss the debut of this modern-day occult exorcism battle manga!\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",
