  "synopsis": "At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the court was corrupt, and years of famine led to the Yellow Turban Rebellion. In Zhuojun, Liu Bei met Zhang Fei and Guan Yu; the three shared the same ideals and swore brotherhood in the Peach Garden. Liu Bei distinguished himself in battle and was appointed magistrate of Anxi County. When a county inspector came to the county to extort bribes, Zhang Fei whipped him. \n\nDong Zhuo, the governor of Liangzhou, received an imperial edict to enter the capital. Lü Bu killed Ding Yuan and surrendered to Dong Zhuo with his head. Dong Zhuo deposed the young emperor and installed the Prince of Chenliu as Emperor Xian. Cao Cao attempted to assassinate Dong Zhuo but failed and fled in disguise. Returning to Chenliu, Cao Cao distributed his wealth to recruit soldiers and, using a false emperor's edict, ordered the warlords to attack Dong Zhuo. The eighteen warlords swore a blood oath to attack Dong Zhuo. Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei fought Lü Bu, who was defeated and moved the capital to Chang'an. Cao Cao led an army to attack Dong Zhuo but was defeated by Lü Bu and fled to Yangzhou. \n\nAfter the alliance disintegrated, Yuan Shao returned to Bohai and gained control of Jizhou. Yuan Shao fought Gongsun Zan at Panhe, and Gongsun Zan was defeated. Sun Jian crossed the river to attack Liu Biao. Liu Biao, heeding Kuai Liang's advice, ambushed and killed Sun Jian with a hail of arrows. Sun Ce replaced his father's body with Huang Zu's and returned to Jiangdong. Dong Zhuo wantonly killed in Chang'an. Wang Yun and Diao Chan secretly devised a scheme to have Lü Bu kill Dong Zhuo. Li Jue and Guo Si, unable to obtain a pardon, besieged Chang'an and killed Wang Yun. Zhang Kai, a general under Tao Qian, murdered Cao Cao's father. \n\nTo avenge his father, Cao Cao personally attacked Tao Qian. Liu Bei aided Tao Qian, and Tao Qian thrice declined Xuzhou. Cao Cao recaptured Yanzhou, defeated Lü Bu, and captured Dingtao. Lü Bu surrendered to Liu Bei and stationed himself at Xiaopei. Guo Si kidnapped the emperor, but Dong Cheng and others rescued him. Cao Cao escorted the emperor to Xudu. Liu Bei attacked Yuan Shu, but Lü Bu attacked Xuzhou. Liu Bei garrisoned at Xiaopei. Lü Bu shot an arrow through the gate of the camp, causing Yuan Shu's general Ji Ling not to attack Liu Bei. Yuan Shu declared himself emperor. Cao Cao, wielding the Emperor's sword, went to war against Yuan Shu. \n\nZhang Xiu surrendered to Cao Cao under Jia Xu's advice, but later turned against Cao Cao because Cao Cao seized his uncle's wife, Zou Shi. He launched a night attack on Cao Cao, who was defeated. Zhang Xiu pursued his victory, inviting Liu Biao to join forces against Cao Cao, but Cao Cao unexpectedly defeated the allied forces with a surprise attack. Forced to return to defend Xuchang due to Yuan Shao's attack, Zhang Xiu was caught off guard. Chen Gong intercepted a letter from Liu Bei allying with Cao Cao, and Lü Bu attacked Liu Bei. Cao Cao sent troops to aid Liu Bei, defeating Lü Bu at Xiaoguan and seizing Xuzhou. Lü Bu was hanged at Baimen Tower. \n\nCao Cao returned to Xuchang, bringing Liu Bei to meet Emperor Xian, recognizing Liu Bei as the emperor's uncle. Dong Cheng, Wang Zifu, and Ma Teng, the governor of Xiliang, secretly signed a pledge of loyalty, awaiting their opportunity. They contacted Liu Bei to launch a rebellion. Cao Cao discussed heroes over wine, and Liu Bei, under the pretext of intercepting Yuan Shu, broke away from Cao Cao. Liu Bei gained Xuzhou. Mi Zhengping, naked, beat a drum and cursed Cao Cao. Cao Cao sent Mi Zhengping to persuade Liu Biao to surrender. Mi Zhengping was killed by Huang Zu. \n\nDong Cheng and the imperial physician Ji Ping conspired to poison Cao Cao, but were betrayed. An imperial edict was found hidden in their belts, and Ji Ping committed suicide by throwing himself against the steps. Dong Cheng and over seven hundred others, along with Consort Dong, were all executed. Cao Cao launched a five-pronged attack on Xuzhou, heading east to conquer Liu Bei. Zhang Fei was defeated and fled to Mangdang Mountain. Liu Bei went to Qingzhou to join Yuan Shao. Guan Yu and Zhang Liao made a three-point agreement at Tushan.\n\n(Source: Bangumi, translated)",
