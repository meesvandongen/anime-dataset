  "synopsis": "The written word is a powerful tool… something Mikimoto knows all too well. Talented and devious, Mikimoto has everything it takes to make a top-rated journalist, but what would a journalist be without a good scandal to write about? Developing his own personal underground newspaper, Mikimoto carefully plants the seeds of anger and wanton lust within his male classmates - all aimed towards just one person: the voluptuous Nanase. When his classmates finally go after her to punish her for all of her \"sins,\" Mikimoto silently records every depraved moment.\n\nAs notoriety of the newspaper spreads, more and more girls are falling prey to the perverse desires of those influenced by it. Even Mikimoto is finding it harder and harder to resist his own dark desires towards one specific full-bosomed beauty, Madoka. Will this master manipulator ultimately fall prey to his own writing talents? \n\n(Source: AniDB)",
