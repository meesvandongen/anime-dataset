As for Ten and his fellow Farmagia friends, they command an army of monsters as they explore and battle across the treacherous lands of the Underworld, collecting resources to take back to their farm. There they'll upgrade their skills as a Farmagia, growing more monsters to nurture, and developing their new traits to aid in their battle against Glaza and the Oración Seis.\n\n(Source: Marvelous USA)",
