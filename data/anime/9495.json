  "synopsis": "The year is 1976, and Giuliana \"Giulia\" Bianchi is a carefree 11-year-old living in the small northern Italian town of Seveso. Panic breaks out when an accident at a nearby chemical plant blankets the town in a strange white powder. With the company operating the plant withholding information, Giulia and her friends team up to find answers on their own. As local animals drop dead and the townspeople develop increasingly frightening symptoms, the situation calls for urgent investigation. Teaming up with Japanese journalist Shirou Andou, the children are determined to expose the truth about the environmental disaster and hold the company that caused it accountable.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
