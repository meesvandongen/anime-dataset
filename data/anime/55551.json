  "synopsis": "This animation was based on a scene I dreamt, where white smoke was rising from a bed. I was influenced by one of Zhuangziâ€™s thought, The butterfly dream, and visualized the contrast between dream and reality. While I was creating this piece, I was never aware of whom the man sleeping in the movie was, but somehow, he ended up looking just like my grandfather.\n\n(Source: Official Website)",
