  "synopsis": "Chacha is a cheerful girl who spends most of her days practicing magic under her teacher Seravi, hoping to become as skilled as he is. Though Chacha is enthusiastic, her tendency to make unfortunate puns out of her magic chants leaves her teacher wondering if she is ready for magic school. Deciding that there is no better time, Seravi gifts Chacha the Princess Medallion, allowing her to transform into a magical princess capable of defeating even the fiercest opponents.\n\nTogether with her best friends Riiya, a werewolf boy, and Shiine, an apprentice of Seravi's old rival, Dorothy, Chacha sets out to defend the world from sinister forces. However, between the Great Evil Lord plotting against them, Riiya and Shiine's rivalry to win Chacha's affection, as well as Seravi and Dorothy's complicated relationship, Chacha struggles to find balance between fighting evil forces and mending relationships in her everyday life. Though obstacles continue to come her way, Chacha is determined to overcome any problem she faces with love, courage, and hope by her side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
