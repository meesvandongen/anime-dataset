  "synopsis": "Goode was once a core member of the mysterious organization ARGUS, but now he has shed its shadow and, along with his naive and innocent sidekick Sura, makes a living by taking on various jobs and earning corresponding rewards. The two always seem to get thankless tasks, from outsmarting aliens to racing bicycles with a shaving maniac… Goode's two mischievous friends—a PhD student skilled in all sorts of useless inventions and a vain, witty guy—always seem to get in the way, making things even more chaotic. Despite this, the \"trouble killer\" Goode, along with his three eccentric companions, tirelessly completes job after job, helping many people in distress.\n\n(Source: iQIYI, Google translated)",
