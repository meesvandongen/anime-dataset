  "synopsis": "\"Kill yourself.\" All it takes are those words to become the next victim. Ignored, slandered, and outcast, she has nowhere to turn. As their cruelty infects her, she begins to lose sight of herself. Her pain just will not go away, and as it consumes her whole being, she feels the only way to cleanse herself is to contaminate another.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
