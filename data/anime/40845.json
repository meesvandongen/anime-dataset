  "synopsis": "Makoto Onodera is the young effeminate chairman of Onodera Academy. Although bestowed exclusive jurisdiction, his administration is threatened by the Kawakara Branch School staff, who intend to usurp his position by consummating marriage with him. That way, the power will be in their hands, and Makoto will be left vulnerable. \n\nHowever, he is accompanied by Kintarou Masaka: his childhood friend, bodyguard, and all-around lover. Kintarou is always one call away from Makoto, and no matter the circumstance, he will rush to save Makoto from his sexual predicaments—just like a knight in shining armor. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
