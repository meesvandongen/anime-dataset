  "synopsis": "A young man wakes up in an unfamiliar room. He has no memory about anything and can't even remember his own name. \n\nWhen he first wakes up there are six maids waiting and worrying about him because he is their new master. One of them tells him his name is Akio. He then learns that he is in a special mansion and will be able to leave only after he manages to resolve his personal issues. The maids are supposed to help him do so, however with no memory he has no idea what personal \"issues\" he needs to resolve.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
