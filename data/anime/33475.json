  "synopsis": "After getting expelled from his previous school, Fudou Nomura decides to enroll in Aichi Coexistence Private Academy. However, the academy is far from ordinary: all female students are armed with weapons! Led by five girls dubbed the Supreme Five Swords, they aim to correct male students' behavior by making them crossdress and integrate into the female student body, or else leave the institution entirely.\n\nOn his first day, Fudou encounters one of the Swords, Rin Onigawara, who tells him to obey the dress code or quit the school. To everyone's surprise, he defies the orders and ends up in a fierce battle with her. With his fighting skills attracting the attention of the rest of the Swords, Fudou must stay vigilant and try his best to survive the girls' antics at his new school.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
