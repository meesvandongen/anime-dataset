  "synopsis": "Transformers' Bumblebee continues his tour in Japan with new chibi-fied versions of the robot by Pop Team Epic's Bkub Okawa and animator Yuzo Yamamoto promoting the Japanese release of the Bumblebee film.\n\nThe Transformers film franchise prequel stars Hailee Steinfeld as Charlie Watson, a girl who comes into possession of the Bumblebee autobot in 1987. The alien robot has lost his voice and has his memory bank damaged before taking the form of an old Volkswagen Beetle and going into hiding. When teenager Charlie Watson gets the Beetle for her birthday, she discovers it to be the mute and amnesiac B-127 and names him \"Bumblebee\", but his presence triggers the arrival of Decepticons Shatter and Dropkick, who receive assistance from Sector 7 to hunt him down. \n\nThe film premiered in Japanese theaters March 22, 2019.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
