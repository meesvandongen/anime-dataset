  "synopsis": "In a fantasy world where humans and demons are long-time enemies, humans choose \"Braves\" as symbols of justice, while \"Demons\" are branded as evil.\nBut when the ancient demon god awakens, the war begins to blur the lines between right and wrong. Power, oppression, and prejudice begin to unravel, forcing every character to question:\nWhat is justice? Who decides what is evil?\nThis isn't just a fantasy adventure—\nIt's a battle of beliefs, freedom, and breaking the labels that define us.\n\n(Source: YouTube)",
