The girls run their own business for odd jobs, willing to take on nearly any request for the right price. When a concerned parent hires Umi, Sora, and Ao to convince her son to return to school, they struggle to convey the importance of a system they do not participate in.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
