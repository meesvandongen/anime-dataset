  "synopsis": "When Takeo Nanachi and a few of his friends visit a rural village in search of inspiration for a theater production, they find the village holding a strange, somber festival that they only practice every few decades. Takeo hopes to use this chance to purify his grandfather's antique sword, but the festival's proceedings leave no opportunity for outsiders to participate. However, after an untimely car failure makes it impossible for Takeo to return home, he finds himself drawn into the villagers' dark and mesmerising practices and forming a bond with Kuraki Fuzuchi, the son of the head priest.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
