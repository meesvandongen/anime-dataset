  "synopsis": "With university entrance exams and graduation drawing close, high school senior Shuumei Sasaki has to start taking his future more seriously. However, Sasaki is increasingly finding it hard to study; all he can think about is his boyfriend and junior, Yoshikazu Miyano. Having only recently made their relationship official, Sasaki cannot help but yearn to hold his boyfriend close. But with Sasaki's graduation on their minds, the couple begins to wonder what lies ahead for them both—especially as a public relationship can garner scrutiny from friends and family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
