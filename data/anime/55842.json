  "synopsis": "Moving from Tokyo to Okinawa island, Teruaki \"Teru\" Nakamura unexpectedly falls in love with his outgoing classmate Hina Kyan, who readily ensures he feels included at his new high school. However, due to her strong local dialect, Teru often has a hard time understanding what Hina is saying. Even so, Hina continues to passionately explain the diverse Okinawan culture to him.\n\nFortunately for Teru, Hina's best friend Kana Higa is eager to help with translation and even offers to teach him useful words and phrases. Yet, Kana has her own reasons—she has developed a crush on Teru and uses this opportunity to talk to him. As Teru, Hina, and Kana spend more time together, unaware of one another's feelings, Teru learns more about his new home and enjoys the company of his friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
