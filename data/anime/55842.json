  "synopsis": "When Teruaki Nakamura transfers to laid-back Okinawa, he falls for the lively Kyan-san—but her dialect is a complete mystery to him. With Higa-san translating, Teru's misunderstanding-filled island life takes off...and subtle hints suggest Higa-san might want his heart too. On this serene island, love flows as freely as the ocean breeze!\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
