  "synopsis": "Oushin Girls' Academy is a respected institution reserved only for wealthy young ladies. Very few of its students excel enough to earn the title of Noble Maiden, awarded to those who embody the ideal Japanese woman of culture and refinement. Lilisa Suzunomiya, a girl of common roots, has suddenly found herself as the daughter of a newly remarried real estate mogul and seeks to become a Noble Maiden to prove that commoners like her can be noble as well.\n\nThe most difficult challenge Lilisa has faced in pursuit of this goal is abandoning her love of rock music to keep up the rich girl facade she must now wear. But her resolve crumbles once she happens upon Otoha Kurogane, the daughter of a prominent politician, skillfully playing the drums while rocking out in an abandoned school building. Despite initially being at odds, they embrace their passion for music together while leading a double life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
