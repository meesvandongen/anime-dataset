  "synopsis": "In the near future, Japan has completely collapsed due to a mix of nuclear warfare, natural disasters, and widespread corruption that sparked a revolution.\n\nThe country is now split into three warring superpowers. This new era of the Three Kingdoms Period sees diplomacy vanish, replaced by a harsh, relentless fight for power. Each territory is using its military strength and resources against the others in a desperate attempt for total control over the remnants of Japanese land.\n\nAoteru Misumi is a low-ranking official who has stayed in the background for most of his life. He does not come from a prestigious military background or aristocracy, but Misumi has a strong ambition: to end the pointless bloodshed that afflicts the nation. He seeks to unify the fractured country, armed only with sharp insight and a persuasive voice that can rally the people.\n\nThe legend of the man who will become a brilliant military strategist starts now.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
