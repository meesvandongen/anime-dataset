  "synopsis": "Ever since he was old enough to hold a crayon, Shinji has loved drawing and has dreamed of becoming a manga artist. When he starts attending school, the only other student who shares his passion is Masaru, who draws people he cares about as luchador wrestlers. As the two grow up, Shinji struggles to hone his skills but Masaru never moves away from his childish style.\n\nWhen Shinji finally moves to Tokyo to chase his dreams, he finds that the road ahead is incredibly difficult and struggles to make a mark on the industry. As Shinji grows increasingly jaded, his childhood friend might just be able to show him that there is more to art than financial success.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
