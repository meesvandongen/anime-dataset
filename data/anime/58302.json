  "synopsis": "Following the success of Shiny Colors' first concert, Mano Sakuragi and her friends continue to face new challenges. After Straylight, a new unit of 283 Production, makes its debut concert, the members of the units are temporarily shuffled into new groups to prepare for a Halloween event to help them grow individually as idols.\n\nWhile Mano struggles to express her ideas, her fellow unit member Hiori Kazano feels left out by her new comrades' talent. At the same time, Fuyuko Mayuzumi, who has bitterly failed to become Straylight's center, proves completely unable to show her real personality, jeopardizing the entire project in the process. Shiny Colors' producer will have to find a way for Fuyuko to break out of her shell if he wants to see his idol units illuminate the world once more.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
