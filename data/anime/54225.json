  "synopsis": "Dog Pool.\nWorried about her weight, Karen Inukai decides to head to the pool and invites her friend Mike Nekotani to come along. Unbeknownst to the dog-phobic Nekotani, their destination is no regular swimming pool—it is a dog pool, where Inukai plans to play with her beloved Pochita. Unfortunately for the trio, Nekotani's fear of dogs soon puts their day of peaceful recreation in jeopardy.\n\nGakuensai Date.\nThe school festival is here, and Inukai has finally gotten a break from working at her class' dog cafe. She takes this opportunity to bring Pochita on a date, but the two immediately run into Inukai's self-proclaimed rival for Pochita's affection, Usagi Tsukishiro, who insists on tagging along. Their tour of the festival attractions soon brings them to a haunted house. When the horrors inside prove too much for both Inukai and Tsukishiro to handle, it is up to Pochita to calm the girls down.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
