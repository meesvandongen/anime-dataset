  "synopsis": "As if bound by fate, five of the world’s most dangerous convicts escape from their respective prisons and converge at Mitsunari Tokugawa’s coliseum, where they seek but one thing: the taste of defeat. It is then Mitsunari who presents them with what they all desire—17-year-old Baki Hanma, the winner of the \"most historic tournament ever,\" along with four other hand-selected opponents. On the spot, it is decided that a five-versus-five battle will ensue between the fighters. The combat can take place anytime, anywhere, and without any restrictions.\n\nWith each contender hellbent on gauging their strength against a worthy adversary, a unique no-holds-barred, out-of-the-ring tournament erupts in the heart of Tokyo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
