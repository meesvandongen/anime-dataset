So when Rina Takaoka transfers into her class from Joutou Academy, a school famous for its combat sports, Natsuki is thrilled to have another girl on her level to spar with. However, Rina harbors emotional baggage from her previous school, as well as a slew of former classmates out for revenge against her. If Natsuki is going to face these new challenges, she will have to develop a finishing move that can help her defeat even the toughest opponents.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
