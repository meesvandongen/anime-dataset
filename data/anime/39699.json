Koji, Hiro, and Kazuki from Over The Rainbow left Edel Rose and established a new agency. They were all keeping quite busy. Meanwhile, after having the title of Prism King stolen by Hiro, the leader of Schwarz Rose, Norizuki Jin, proposes PRISM.1, which would decide a new king other than Prism King. He then announces that Schwarz Rose and Edel Rose will be competing with each other. While everyone is preparing for PRISM.1, Yukinojo is torn between being in kabuki and the Prism Show. He doesn’t feel like he’s living up to his potential in either and doesn’t know what to do. His father sees him like this and tells him to leave the world of Prism Shows...\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
