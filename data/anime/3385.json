  "synopsis": "While working as an informant for the Venetian government, Casius travels to the grand and lustrous city of Constanivole to meet his longtime friend Falco. As he is giving him a tour of the city, Falco suggests they visit the slave market: a place where captured women are sold at exorbitant prices to wealthy bureaucrats. Casius is initially hesitant to take part in the debauchery, but eventually has a change of heart and buys the girls in order to protect them. Unbeknownst to him, the girls he purchased will soon send him headfirst into a series of tumultuous events.\n\nDorei Ichiba follows Casius as he spends his days in the foreign city with his three slaves—Bianca, a childish woman who calls him 'big brother'; Cecilia, a peasant who ran away from her abusive, blue-blooded fiance; and Myia, a mute girl with dark secrets. As he uncovers their tragic stories while making love to them, he finds himself slowly succumbing to a carnal desire that threatens to change him for good.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
