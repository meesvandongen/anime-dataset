  "synopsis": "Having moved away due to family circumstances, Suzuko Homura returns to her hometown, nostalgic about the cheerful childhood she shared with Chinatsu Morikawa. Forever sealed with a promise of friendship, those days remain a bright memory to Suzuko, yet she has lost contact with Chinatsu during their time apart.\n\nReady to start anew, Suzuko endeavors to put the past behind her and make new friends at school, but she struggles to do so. Meanwhile, Chinatsu is working multiple shifts to support her family as she continues her studies, and the mounting pressure to meet high expectations soon becomes overwhelming. Amid their respective situations, both girls begin playing the popular card game WIXOSS and discover that they have been chosen as Selectorsâ€”players whose memories are now represented by gold coins and must battle other Selectors to earn five of them.\n\nGuided by their LRIG avatar cards, which are created from the user's memories, the two learn that inconsistently partaking in duels or losing all their coins will result in a grim outcome. Resolved to protect what they hold dear, Suzuko and Chinatsu prepare for the battles ahead and fight for the chance to reclaim themselves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
