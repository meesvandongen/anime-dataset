  "synopsis": "Sakamoto has it all: he is handsome, he excels at his studies, and there is no situation he cannot handle with style. Not having lost their admiration for him, Sakamoto's former classmates recall the days when he graced the halls of their school before moving to America. As they imagine his life abroad, they figure that there is only one place suitable for their perfect friend—NASA. It seems that even in his absence, Sakamoto continues to enchant all who were lucky enough to meet him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
