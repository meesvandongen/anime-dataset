  "synopsis": "While Nachi Tsukisuzu's world-renowned violin performances are spectacular, her academics are the complete opposite. With various supplementary classes that she must take, she will not be able to graduate if she fails in the upcoming term. Concerned for their upperclassman, the rest of the band members lend a hand to Nachi in hopes that she can pass.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
