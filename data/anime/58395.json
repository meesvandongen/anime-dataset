  "synopsis": "Once an average office worker, an old man finds himself reincarnated as a sweet little cat named Pun-chan. Unsure of how he got into this position, he tries to find his way around in his new body. However, the cat soon runs into familiar faces—including his former boss, who quickly becomes fond of him. Regardless, there does not seem to be a dull day ahead for Pun-chan as he learns to adapt to his new life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
