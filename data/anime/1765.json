  "synopsis": "Due to his involvement with an international terrorist group, Kuki Kosaburo flees to France to live under an assumed identity. Kuki has few worries, now spending his time enjoying alcohol and women—until French government agent George Lasaar captures him for his crimes. But rather than throwing him in jail, Lasaar offers Kuki a deal: in exchange for his freedom, Kuki must help him investigate the American Central Intelligence Agency's operations in France. Kuki soon becomes entangled in a strange plot involving the blood of famous pop star Lamia Vindaw, leading him to discover another opposing group that he never imagined even existed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
