  "synopsis": "Lingwu Continent is a world where spiritual power and martial spirit coexist. A spiritual cultivator can move mountains and rivers with a thought, and a martial artist can tear the world apart with bare hands. Chen Tian, ​​a former genius in Xingchen Town, lost his martial spirit and dried up his spiritual sea after he turned ten.\n\nSince then, he has become a waste of his family and has been looked down upon by others. In a life-and-death struggle, Chen Tian fell off a cliff and mistakenly entered the formation arranged by the ancient sword emperor. Under the influence of the power of the heavenly book, he awakened his spiritual and martial dual cultivation physique. At the same time, he also obtained a strange memory and a mysterious storage ring. \n\nFrom then on, he rose from adversity, broke through the reincarnation of the Heavenly Dao Palm, and finally crossed the shackles of the emperor's calamity and aspired to become the champion of Lingwu Continent!\n\n(Source: iQIYI)",
