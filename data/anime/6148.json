  "synopsis": "After graduating high school, Yurume Aida joins the ranks of \"ronin,\" students taking an extra year to prepare for college entrance exams. She decides to move from her rural hometown to Tokyo, hoping to take advantage of the cram schools and get a taste of city life. However, the country girl is shocked to learn that her boarding house, the Maison du Wish, is much less glamorous than she had imagined. As Yurume joins her neighbors and fellow ronin in scraping by with their meager funds, she finds a place in her community—even if she rarely ends up studying.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
