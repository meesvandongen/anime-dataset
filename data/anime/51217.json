  "synopsis": "There was a notorious group of pickup artists around campus -- everywhere they went, they\ntried to hook up with women. Then one day, after an incident with a gang of thugs, all the\nmembers of this obnoxious group died.\n\nHowever, when they woke up they were in another world! And there's no reason they can't\npick up girls there, too...\n\n(Source: DLSite, translated)",
