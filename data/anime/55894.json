  "synopsis": "After an accident that killed his father and left his sister with a disability, Shun Tokinoya's mental duress has led to him refraining from online gaming. Now a model high school student who feels remorse over his past lifestyle, Shun works part-time in the cybercafe owned by his childhood friend Nozomi Inatsuki in order to support his family. \n\nDespite this, an incident pushes Shun back into the world of online gaming. Following the sudden retirement of all players of FOX ONE—Nozomi's father’s esports team—Shun learns that the Inatsuki family is in severe debt. In order to repay the money they owe, Shun reluctantly agrees to participate in an online game tournament: Xaxerion Championship.\n\nJoined by their classmate Akito Sendou, the three of them scout for talented players to rebuild the team. Although they are lucky to find two promising additions to FOX ONE, it is too soon to celebrate: if Shun does not let go of his guilty conscience, the makeshift team stands no chance at winning the tournament.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
