  "synopsis": "Introverted university student Mako Kawai has a hobby of watching food videos and cooking what she learns from them. She is now a far cry from her energetic self back in elementary school—due to her growing social anxiety, she fears trying new things, such as going to restaurants alone or even making friends.\n\nEnter Shinon Ogawa, one of Mako's childhood friends with whom she reunites in college. Still as extroverted as ever, Shinon quickly adopts Mako into her friend group, which includes the easygoing Tsutsuji Higa and the level-headed Kurea Furutachi. Together, they are planning to start a Food Culture Research Club and invite Mako to join as their fourth member. Though she initially declines, Mako soon realizes that this is her chance to finally brighten up her days, enjoy life surrounded by friends, and eat delicious food with everyone!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
