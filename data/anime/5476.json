The candies have the power to make her 10 years older or younger, as well as turn her into any animal she wants. Using her newfound abilities, Melmo wears various disguises as a 19-year-old woman and looks after her brothers, all while still trying to lead a normal life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
