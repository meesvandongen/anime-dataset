  "synopsis": "Following the awakening of her Dream-Sight ability, Miyo Saimori reunites with her fiancé, Kiyoka Kudou, the captain of the special forces protecting the country against ill-intended individuals gifted with exceptional powers. However, the couple's blissful life is suddenly interrupted when Takaihito, the top contender for the imperial throne, sends Kiyoka on a dangerous mission.\n\nTraveling with Miyo to the remote household of his parents, Kiyoka must investigate unusual reports of demons in the region. Meanwhile, Miyo tries to gain the approbation of her callous mother-in-law, Fuyu, who refuses to recognize her as a family member.\n\nAfter Kiyoka repels an attack by the Gifted Communion, a subversive sect of special abilities wielders, he returns to the capital alongside his fiancée. As the looming threat against the imperial authority intensifies, Kiyoka must thwart the Gifted Communion's plans to protect Miyo and everyone he holds dear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
