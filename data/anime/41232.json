  "synopsis": "LOL: Lots of Laugh is an electropop song sung by Hatsune Miku. In the song, Miku and a stuffed rabbit explore a surreal wonderland with lots of candy. It is heavily implied that Miku has simply lost her sense of reality or has fallen asleep (possibly both) while on her computer late at night.\n\n(Source: Vocaloid Wiki)",
