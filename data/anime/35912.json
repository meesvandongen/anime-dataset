Disguised as a commoner, Princess Froglegs befriends street vendor, Freddie, and begins training with him for the games--determined that she will win and thwart her Father's plans of marriage. Meanwhile, the villainous Serpent has ideas of his own to ruin the Froglympics and take over the kingdom. With a little luck, and a little help from their trusty Sidekick, Freddie and Princess Froglegs must save Frog Kingdom from the evil Serpent. \n\n(Source: Amazon.com)",
