  "synopsis": "One day, Toki Mishiba receives a letter in the mail promising him a large sum of money if he participates in a game. Initially dismissing the message, Toki becomes intrigued and decides to sign up after noticing fine print that says players' safety will not be guaranteed. It is not long after that he meets Nobuto Nakajou and Kazuo Saitouâ€”the teammates assigned to him in the \"Business Game,\" also known as \"Biz Game.\"\n\nThe members of the trio quickly form a shaky alliance and call themselves \"No Name.\" Bound by nothing but their shared desire for an obscene amount of money, the three step into the dangerous world of the Biz Game, where they must fight against other teams over a data disk containing vital corporate secrets in order to advance and survive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
