  "synopsis": "Produced as a short experimental trial series of only 3 episodes and filmed in black and white. Inspired in part by the novel \"Deep Range\" by Arthur C. Clarke, the tale of an undersea boy (Dolphin Prince) with a pet dolphin, who swam in a wetsuit with a built-in jetpack and stunned his enemies with an aqua-boomerang. The episodes featured his mermaid friend Neptuna and Dr. Mariner, with stories entitled \"Secret Of The Red Vortex\", \"Call Of The Sea\" and \"Attack Of The Sea-Star People.\"\n\n(Source: Wikipedia and The Anime Encyclopedia) ",
