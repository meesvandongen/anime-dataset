  "synopsis": "The short film tells the story of a French philosopher named Sophie, who visits Fukushima Prefecture for the first time to attend a friend's wedding. Sophie loses her way in Fukushima, but a mysterious \"friend\" and a \"map\" appear before her, and she follows their lead making detours and stops. Little by little, Sophie realizes that everything in Fukushima is a \"culture\" that has been created by someone and has been passed down through generations.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
