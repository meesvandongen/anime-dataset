  "synopsis": "The girls of Momotsuki Academy's Class 1-C are starting their tenth-grade year with a brand-new instructor. The good news? The teacher is an MIT grad. The bad news? She's only 11 years old! So, while Becky Miyamoto may be an intellectual titan, this child prodigy is painfully ill-equipped to deal with the group of temperamental teens—and idiotic aliens—that await her instructions!\n\n(Source: Funimation)",
