  "synopsis": "Our lives in the real world stand at the crossroads of countless decisions. The characters of this film—Maro and Crow, the department chief Ms. Kim, Sweet Potato and Titi, Ye-mi and Gang-bo—live in an imaginary animated world, but they face the real life concerns that confront all of us. This story takes a funny yet bittersweet look at the vast gulf between the reality and ideals of our lives at different moments—before we make a choice, during the process of choosing, and after a choice has been made.\n\n(Source: Korean Film Biz Zone)",
