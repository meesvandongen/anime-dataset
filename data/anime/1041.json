  "synopsis": "On his way back from his late-night job at a gas station, Takuto Izumi spots a young man passed out drunk on the side of the road. He feels compelled to take the person to his apartment to recover; however, he is shocked to find out the next day that the person he rescued is the incredibly popular musician and model, Kouji Nanjou. Takuto would rather end their relationship there so he can focus on dominating high school soccer, but something about Takuto's eyes compels Kouji to stick around.\n\nWhen Kouji learns that Takuto's mother murdered his father and Takuto was the sole witness, his fascination with him only increases. As their paths continue to intertwine, Kouji's feelings start to change from admiration to a dangerous obsession.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
