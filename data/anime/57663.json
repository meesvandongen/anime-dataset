  "synopsis": "Pei Qian, an ordinary migrant worker, was accidentally bound to the wealth conversion system, which gave him a good opportunity to spend money in business and start his life over again. However, the system stipulates that you can only earn one yuan if you make a profit of 100 yuan, but all the money you lose can go into your own pocket. In order to lose money, Pei Qian chose the high-risk, money-burning game industry, and deliberately produced \"alternative\" games that went against the rules of the market. However, he unexpectedly became popular time and time again, earning a lot of money, and painfully became Pei Qian the \"business wizard\" admired by everyone, but only Pei Qian understands that he really just wants to lose money...\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
