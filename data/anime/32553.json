  "synopsis": "Shinkon\nFinally working in his ideal career as a public servant, Raku Ichijou is able to return home to his loving wife and whisk his worries away. Between freshly prepared meals and his wife's endless affection, Ichijou can think of little else to wish for—but such a seemingly perfect reality may be misleading.\n\nMagical Patissiere Kosaki-chan!!\nDr. Maiko's presence causes peace in Boyari City to remain elusive, but justice is not far away. Learning from their recent efforts, the Magical Princess, ruler of the Land of Magic, tasks Magical Patissiere Kosaki, Magical Police Marika, and Magical Gorilla Chitoge to finish Dr. Maiko for good. However, in order to avoid a repeat of their previous battle, the trio must formulate a brand new strategy to defeat the brazen villain.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
