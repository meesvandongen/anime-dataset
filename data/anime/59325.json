  "synopsis": "Satoshi Totsugawa, a 39-year-old man working at a small advertising agency in the city, is proud, vain, and full of complexes. He laments his own situation, which is far below his wife's annual income, is manipulated by a poor junior at work, and cannot hide his infidelity from a fellow designer. He is a middle-aged man who is on the path to a life of complaints. But then Satoshi is appointed head of the apartment building association, and is manipulated by the eccentric residents! Set in the ultra-futuristic tower apartment building \"Keihin Grand Solenase\" that towers into the sky above Keihin, this is a realistic, yet comical and loving portrayal of modern people's communication patterns.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, translated)",
