The bellicose Sazorions tried to conquer the peaceful Plazmans using the dreadful power of the Scorpio in outer space.\n\nTwenty thousand years later-at some time in the future-Dr. Godo, the only survivor of the Plazmans, secretly prepares Ginguiser, the combined magic robot troop, to defend peace in the event that the Sazorions are revived. Dr. Godo commands four brave young men to acquire occult super powers.\n\nEach episode of this series features a sequence of fabulous and fantastic battles. These scenes cannot fail to arouse the interest and excitement of the audience, and will be certain to catch every eye.\n\n(Source: Nippon Animation)",
