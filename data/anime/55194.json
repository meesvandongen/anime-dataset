  "synopsis": "Trying to move on in his life, former professional golfer Kazuyoshi Igarashi arrives at Hinoshima Island for a job at its development center. Expecting the island to be a very rural area with nothing much to offer, Kazuyoshi cannot hide his amazement when he discovers a complete golf course made by the island's inhabitants. Using the seaside terrain to their advantage, the people there have adopted golfing as their hobby.\n\nTo add to his surprise, Kazuyoshi meets a young girl named Tonbo Ooi, who has been playing golf using only a 3-iron—a notoriously difficult-to-use club. As the former pro gets more involved with Tonbo and witnesses her seemingly impossible shots, he begins to see golf in a whole new light, rediscovering how fun the sport can actually be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
