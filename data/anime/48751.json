  "synopsis": "A massive spacetime wormhole appeared on Earth one day, connecting various unknown worlds. The known evil force is the Death Singer from the Shadow World. Thus, the Time God Zilean, the Wandering Mage, and the Great Inventor Dinghei established a Super God Academy on Earth, recruiting powerful gods from various timelines, as well as super soldiers who had already planted seeds on Earth, such as Garen. But before everything unfolded, Garen and the other Earth warriors were unaware of all this information; they had to start as students and slowly embark on the path to becoming super gods to protect their world.\n\n(Source: Bangumi, translated)",
