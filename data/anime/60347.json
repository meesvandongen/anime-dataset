The sisters lead a double life as a trio of highly skilled art thieves, leaving cards with the name \"Cat's Eye\" at the scene of their crimes. They steal works of art that belonged to their long-missing father, Heinz who was a famous art collector during the Nazi regime, in the hopes of him contacting them.
