  "synopsis": "Athlon Tobot is a sports-themed spin-off series of Tobot set in the same universe.\n\nElementary school student and Robot Racing super-fan Kyle Hughes finally gets the chance to live out his dreams, and joins the League with Alpha, Beta and Theta— the three Athlons built by his mother, Dr. Hughes. \n\nUnfortunately he soon discovers that his former idol Mavrik Stone, famous Robot Racing Champion and media darling, is actually a super-villain responsible for the slew of rigged and sabotaged races that have been cropping up in the competition. Kyle is determined to protect the sport he loves and with the help of his family and his friend Tori Wade, he embarks on a mission to weed out corruption from the League and reveal Mavrik for the cheater he truly is. \n\nThe best way for Team Athlon to do that? Make it as far as they can in the racing competition.\n\n(Source: Tobot Wiki)",
