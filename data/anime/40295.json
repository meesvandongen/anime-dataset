  "synopsis": "On the surface, high school students Naomi Katagaki and Ruri Ichigyou seem to be polar opposites. In contrast to Naomi's shy and timid personality, Ruri strikes fear in her classmates due to being rather cold and outspoken. Nevertheless, both Naomi and Ruri nourish a strong passion for reading, which gradually draws the two closer.\n\nAs Naomi spends more time with Ruri, he discovers that she has a sweet side and is not as intimidating as everyone thinks. Subsequently, he develops genuine feelings for Ruri and decides to confess his love to her, which she happily reciprocates.\n\nHowever, their wholehearted relationship is disrupted when Ruri gets struck by lightning, causing her to enter a coma. Wanting to see her smile again, Naomi resolves to return Ruri to her everyday life—no matter how great the lengths he must stride are.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
