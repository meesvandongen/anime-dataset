One day, he receives a visit from Satsuki Satonaka, his tomboyish childhood friend who once excelled at basketball. When an accident ended her ambitions prematurely, Kusuki was the one who rescued Satsuki, earning him lifelong gratitude from her and her family.\n\nAfter discovering Kusuki's porn magazine collection, Satsuki teases him about it.
