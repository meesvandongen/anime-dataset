  "synopsis": "On a fateful day, a young girl named Ai takes a taxi to her new home in Animal Village. After being swindled by her landlord, Tanukichi, into working for his delivery service, it is not long before Ai meets other village residents: Kotobuki, the mayor perpetually worried about his reelection; Yuu, the only other human around, with a passion for random antics and costumes; Bouquet, an overly energetic but rather friendly cat; and Sally, an elephant who dreams of being a fashion designer. New friends seem to lurk in every nook and cranny, but despite that, Ai still struggles to find her niche in this town—until some mysterious notes left on the beach give her a glimpse of a greater purpose.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
