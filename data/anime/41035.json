  "synopsis": "The song is about a girl (blue) who has dreams of Melty Land. Blue is lonely and sad, and Pink exists to make Blue happier. The forks and dinnertime represent Blue \"consuming\" her dreams. That's her way of coping with the mean things her classmates and mom might say. At the end, Blue stops relying on Pink, so they disappear.",
