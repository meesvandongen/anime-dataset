  "synopsis": "Based on the Japanese folk belief of Womb Diving (Tainai Kuguri) or the \"unknown hollow spiritual world\". In Japanese, the word for womb, \"tainai\", not only refers to the female organ of the uterus, but also refers to the animistic spiritual hollow space inside a Buddhist statue. This is a space of connection, between life and afterlife, death and life. There, the boundaries between organism and matter dissolve, and outer and inner worlds are continually inverted. \n\n(Source: Official Site)",
