  "synopsis": "Wealthy, handsome, and successful, Arthur Louis Zetes is no stranger to the greed of people. Constantly doubting those around him, he has no faith in humanity; thus, he makes a request for the perfect maid—a robot maid. However, his butler is unable to acquire such a servant due to technological limitations, so he finds the next best substitute.\n\nMarie Evans is a former child prodigy in martial arts known for her lack of expression. Drowning in debt, she readily accepts the offer to be a maid that acts like a robot. While Arthur is often blunt towards humans, he cannot help but dote on his personal robot; in turn, Marie is moved by his drive and consideration toward her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
