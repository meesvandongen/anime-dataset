  "synopsis": "The ground shakes, a rumble follows, and before anyone in Japan can prepare themselves, a cataclysmic volcanic eruption engulfs the country in molten lava and suffocating ashes. Of course, high school student Kusou Saiki repeatedly uses his psychic powers to prevent this harrowing catastrophe.\n\nBut between restoring the planet and watching his friends discuss their aspirations, Saiki finally resolves to stop the eruption and allow the world to continue spinning. However, this straightforward task is challenging even for the most powerful of psychics, let alone one who must deal with the usual shenanigans his ludicrous friends present.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
