  "synopsis": "With the defeat of the Bilusaludo's nanometal city, the destruction of humanity seems inevitable. Worse yet, Captain Haruo Sakaki's refusal to sacrifice his humanity has come under fire from the remaining Bilusaludo troops, who blame him for their defeat. In their darkest moment, the few surviving humans turn to the religion of the Exifs, which promises that devotion is the path to salvation from Godzilla.\n\nHowever, the Exif are not what they seem. As the survivors become more and more zealous in their devotion, Sasaki wonders what exactly the priest Metphies is hiding—especially regarding his relationship with the monster known as Ghidorah.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
