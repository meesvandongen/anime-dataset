  "synopsis": "It is said that the sole way to gain skills is to eat a fruit called Skill Fruit. Each person may eat only one during their life, as ingesting a second would result in instant death. Light Underwood wishes for a powerful skill that would allow him to become an adventurer with his childhood friend Lena Floria. When the day of selection arrives, the excited boy regrettably acquires Fruitmaster, a skill which merely improves his cultivation of fruits. Even worse, he is separated from Lena when she obtains an exceptional ability.\n\nAlthough disappointed by the result, Light begins his life as a farmer and takes in a young girl named Ayla Lawrence. One day, due to a misunderstanding, the two consume Skill Fruits. However, instead of dying, Light miraculously receives a second skill, suited for combat, with his original ability. Now seemingly the only person who can gain multiple skills, Light wants to catch up to Lena and make history as the strongest adventurer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
