  "synopsis": "After a sudden crash, a performing troupe finds the remains of a ruined spaceship with a single survivor—a human infant named Corona. With little knowledge of the baby's home planet or culture, the troupe members decide to take on their most challenging roles yet—that of a human family. As Corona grows up, the group starts to consider the consequences of their decision and what they will do if someone from her home planet tries to reclaim her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
