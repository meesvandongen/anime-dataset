  "synopsis": "Readyyy! is Sega's male idol training smartphone game. Within it is a 3-unit group called RayGlanZ. This is their official music video for their Go Now! song. RayGlanZ is the first unit that received a short MV (February 16, 2018). Shortly after that, a longer version of the MV was released for a limited time. The longer version was released again due to demand and reached over 200k views during the period it was released for another limited time.\n\n(Source: Readyyy Project Wikia)\n",
