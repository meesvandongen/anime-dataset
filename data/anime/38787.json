  "synopsis": "To the students of Karai High School, Nanako Yukishiro is a pretty, calm, and cute 16-year-old. However, Nanako is no ordinary girl, as she cannot speak! Instead, Nanako communicates through senryuu—17-syllable-long poems. \n\nSixteen-year-old Eiji Busujima used to be delinquent in his middle school years. However, he has since turned over a new leaf due to his newfound love of senryuu. Despite his menacing looks, Eiji gets along well with Nanako as a fellow member of the Literature Club.\n\nEven though Nanako is mute, the adorable pair have no problem communicating with each other. Senryuu Shoujo is a light and relaxing story of two teenagers' daily lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
