  "synopsis": "Renji Kusakabe, an arcade employee, one day notices a small foreign girl struggling to win a stuffed toy called \"Manly Koala\" from a crane game. Three hours later, after finishing his shift, Renji sees the girl still at the game, but the toy remains unmoved.\n\nFeeling sorry for her, he decides to help. He inserts a 100-yen coin and, with one skillful try, wins the toy, which he then hands to the girl. Startled by this unexpected gesture, the girl looks at Renji with suspicion. Flustered, Renji hastily tells her it's a Valentine's Day gift. Little does he know, in her home country of England, Valentine's Day is traditionally when men give women gifts along with a confession of love.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
