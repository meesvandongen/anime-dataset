  "synopsis": "Lily Baker, a young English girl, decides to go to an arcade on Valentine's Day. She is determined to win a stuffed animal from a claw machine; but even after attempting it for hours, she is unable to get her hands on the prize. Just as she is about to give up, arcade employee Renji Kusakabe steps in and wins the prize for her as a present to celebrate the special day. Due to her cultural background, however, Lily mistakes his action as a declaration of love!\n\nWith Lily returning to the same arcade in the hopes of seeing Renji again, the two begin exchanging a notebook to learn more about each other and their respective cultures. This marks the start of a friendship filled with gaming, but that is not enough for Lily, as she swears to make Renji fall in love with her!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
