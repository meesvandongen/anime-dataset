  "synopsis": "When the all-lesbian crew of the spacecraft Muse receives a distress call from the cargo ship Zogne in deep space, they set out to recover any possible survivors. Finally reaching the wreckage, the crew is shocked to find the bodies of the Zogne men as dried-up husks, while all the women are naked and covered in strange green residue. After rescuing the sole survivor—Flair Mytomeyer, a young woman being kept in a cold sleep—the crew of the Muse hastily returns to its ship, hoping to forget the unpleasant sights.\n\nHowever, one crew member aboard the Muse suddenly exhibits the same symptoms as observed on the Zogne, and the rest scramble to determine the cause. As the crewmate Annie manages to access the data on the Zogne ship's drive, terror begins to set in, for she learns just who exactly the ship's latest addition is.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
