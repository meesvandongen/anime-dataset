  "synopsis": "In 2048, the Lingyun system, as the first case of \"smart brain popularization application\", will be tried out in the city of Mirage. The accident at the Lingyun system conference that day triggered an emotional entanglement between its founders Zhou Tong, Zhao Feibai, and childhood friends Ayigul, Aizmat. In order to achieve his goals, Zhou Tong closed the \"brain consciousness\" of Zhao Feibai, Ayigul and Aizmat in the sandbox space of the Lingyun system, but inadvertently triggered the system's \"initial intelligent AI\" ------Lucoco's start. Everything is connected to the \"imprint\" game in the memories of the four people that year, an intelligence crisis with the code of \"human heart fetters\" unfolding between the real and virtual worlds.\n\n(Source: qq.com)",
