  "synopsis": "After living peaceful days at the Kamiya dojo, Kenshin Himura finds himself at a crucial crossroads, as his vow to never end a life is put to the ultimate test.\n\nFollowing the murder of his former commander, he now has to retread the road of violence and blood to take down Makoto Shishio—the assassin prodigy who calls himself the notorious Battousai's successor. With ambitions to overthrow the Meiji government and establish his dominion in Kyoto, Shishio has meticulously schemed for a decade, building a formidable anti-government military force. Now, Shishio has turned his sights toward recruiting Aoshi Shinomori, a cold-blooded killer and the former leader of the legendary Oniwaban Group warriors.\n\nAs Kenshin travels through a village abandoned by the government and currently under the iron fist of Shishio's henchmen, he is determined to prevent the country from spiraling back into civil war. He allies with his former rival, Hajime Saitou, forging a fragile partnership in a battle against Shishio's empire that will determine the fate of Japan.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
