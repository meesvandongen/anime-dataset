Between his dangerous missions, Justy enjoys spending time with his two sisters—including the secretly adopted Astaris Vega, the daughter of the same infamous criminal Justy once killed. With the criminals of the galaxy upset at Justy's success, they begin to hatch a plan to rid the universe of him in order for their reign of terror to go unchecked.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
