Despite being an AI, she has captured the hearts of her fans, including Miracle, an aspiring virtual artist, with her performances. As Miracle attends ADEN Academy, a school for virtual artists, she makes new friends while learning more about singing, performing, and streaming. \n\nMiracle's ultimate goal is to win the prestigious Lapin d'Or at the Virtual Grid Awards, an achievement Kizuna has earned five consecutive times. To do this, she works to improve her channel ranking through streams and performances, trying to stand out among other students at the academy.
