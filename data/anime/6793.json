  "synopsis": "Earl Ciel Phantomhive's Funtom Corporation is sponsoring a charity performance of Hamlet to be shown to a group of poor children as a celebration of its third anniversary. However, when the theater company hired for the stage play is suddenly delayed and won't make it in time for the scheduled performance, the company is faced with a dilemma. With the promise of plenty of press coverage, Ciel must find a way to rectify the situation and commands his butler, Sebastian Michaelis, to ensure the success of the play.\n\nBut with a haphazard ensemble of amateur actors—including Ciel, his fiancée Elizabeth Midford, his servants, and many others—how can they possibly put on the show in time?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
