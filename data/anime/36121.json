  "synopsis": "Ikkyuu Nyuukon begins with a long story, followed by three short, independent stories.\n\nIn the first story, Naoto has a crush on Kaori from the volleyball club. Naoto's classmate Nao offers to introduce him to Kaori, as Nao is in the same club as Kaori. In return, she asks for three desserts, which Naoto accepts as fair. When Nao tries to arrange a meeting between Kaori and Naoto, she meets with an insurmountable refusal from Kaori, much to her regret. Saki, the president of the volleyball club, becomes aware of this and immediately recognises the opportunity to derive the greatest possible benefit from this matter – both for the club and for herself and her friend. Using Nao's mobile phone, Saki summons Naoto to a meeting with Kaori. There, however, Saki, Megumi and Nao have already prepared a few things to win Naoto over as manager of the volleyball club. Naoto is also unable to reject Saki's other proposals \n\nSource: Anisearch)",
