  "synopsis": "Every afternoon, tucked away in a corner of a local shopping mall's food court, two high school girls unwind and share a meal. Wada may seem like a soft-spoken honor student, but she is actually quite talkative and has an addiction to mobile games. Meanwhile, Yamamoto appears to be a stoic gal, but she is obsessed with internet mysteries and all things American. Nevertheless, within this food court, they carve out a strong friendship built on unfiltered conversations and the little absurdities that make everyday life a bit more bearable.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
