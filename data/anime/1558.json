  "synopsis": "Years ago, the sex demon Yarudazuigu almost conquered the world but was thwarted by a group of warriors with sacred rings. Now, before Frostbite and his partner, Amabire, can reawaken Yarudazuigu, they must find and defeat the heirs to the rings. Two of these warriors, the lustful Rima and the more reserved Kuri, use their powers to protect those who cannot defend themselves. However, when Amabire attempts to take advantage of their pure hearts and high libidos, the girls must resist temptation to prevent the sex demon's return.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
