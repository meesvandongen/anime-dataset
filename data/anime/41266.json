  "synopsis": "Although primarily working as a vase painter in Ancient Greece, Demetrios is berated for his lack of resolve and ability to keep a cool head in a crisis. One day, he is suddenly struck by lightning and transported to Tokyo in 1964, the first year Japan hosted the Summer Olympics. \n\nMore than accommodated by a family who simply excuses him as a harmless foreigner, Demetrios ends up bringing the knowledge he has gained from the modern era to his own time period whenever he returns after being zapped by lightning. As he repeatedly travels between the two eras, Demetrios learns to impress his fellow villagers and begins to stand up for himself—all just in time to become stronger and organize and participate in his own Olympics back at home.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
