  "synopsis": "A parody series featuring the entire cast of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya in a smaller form factor.  Among the changes are: Yuki plays eroge, Haruhi is even more obnoxiuous and loud, Mikuru is even more emotional and Koizumi harbors a deep love for Kyon.  Kyon, on the other hand, is generally the same as ever.",
