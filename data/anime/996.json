At the same time, the Three Lights apper, an idol trio consisting of three boys, Seiya, Taiki, and Yaten. The new enemy is Galaxia, a woman who desires to rule the entire galaxy by collecting the Star Seeds of humans. Three new Senshi appear, the Sailor Starlights, who have their own reasons to stop Galaxia, but without Sailor Moon's help.",
