  "synopsis": "Chu Yi, a young man born with a silver spoon in his mouth, predicted the apocalypse where game gear merged with reality and decided to join the game with 30 billion. Thus, he became the Mighty Whale, Chu Tiange, in the game The Era. With his abundant fortune, Chu Tiange managed to get the fanciest gear, the most powerful weapons, and the class with the most advantages. For other players, Chu Tiange is a walking Boss disguised as a player. And for the Bosses, Chu Tiange is the mighty and fearsome Archaean Dragonking. The future might be unavoidable, and the barrier between reality and the virtual world might be brought down eventually, yet Chu Tiange will reverse the apocalypse and control the whole new era in the name of the Dragonking.\n\n(Source: Youku)",
