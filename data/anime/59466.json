  "synopsis": "Ever since the quiet and timid Reina Aharen enrolled in high school, she has made new friends and even started dating her classmate Matsuboshi Raidou. When the two begin their second year, everything seems to be going well, as they are seatmates once more.\n\nSoon after, a transfer student named Riku Tamanaha joins their class. Unbeknownst to Reina, the outgoing and stylish girl is actually a childhood friend she separated from years ago. With Raidou's support, Reina is able to rekindle their friendship.\n\nAlthough they have grown closer, Raidou and Reina still struggle to communicate due to his overactive imagination and her difficulty with expressing herself. Nevertheless, the eccentric couple continues to brighten up the lives of people around them as they enjoy each other's company to the fullest.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
