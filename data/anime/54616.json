  "synopsis": "On her way to meet friends for drinks, Kaoru Nagase suddenly collapses. While attempting to fix a distortion in the space-time continuum, the god managing Earth made a mistake that resulted in Kaoru's death. Fortunately, the god preserves her mind and soul, granting her a second chance at life in another world, Verny.\n\nTo make up for this divine error, Verny's goddess Celestine provides Kaoru with various blessings: a youthful body, proficiency in all languages, an item box with infinite storage, and—most importantly—the ability to spontaneously create any kind of potion, limited only by her imagination. However, her powers prove too advanced for a medieval world like Verny. As she tries to enjoy her new life and escape those who covet her abilities, Kaoru travels across different nations—but the bits of influence she leaves behind may soon amass into something out of control.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
