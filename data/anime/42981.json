  "synopsis": "Despite performing as an idol group for three years, Idolls! has failed to make its mark on the entertainment world, only boasting a meager three fans. While the girls are venting their frustrations, a small wooden statue in their room suddenly starts speaking to them and convinces them to book a venue that seats one hundred fans. The only problem is that their performance is in just nine days! Now in a race against time, the girls must prove themselves worthy of stardom or face the harsh reality of failure.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
