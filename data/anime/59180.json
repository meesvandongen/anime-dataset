  "synopsis": "Shen La, a special investigator of the \"Poll Bureau\" of the mysterious incident management agency, was seriously injured in the execution of his mission. When he was about to die, he accepted the inheritance of Wu Rendi, the director of the Sixth Office - a \"seed\" containing mysterious power. After regaining consciousness, Wu Rendi's senior brother Guangren accepted him as his disciple. In order to find the fragments of the Tianli Diagram, Shen La, after going through the Tianshan Wolf Tomb, energy backlash, foundation conspiracy and other incidents, was finally recognized by Wu Rendi and received the ancient artifact-the Twin Swords of Crime and Punishment given by him. At the same time, the problem of the insider in the polling bureau became more complicated and confusing, and Shen La and her partner Sun Desheng went into battle again.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, Google translated)",
