  "synopsis": "Living in constant monotone, Takeru Kamishiro longs for a change in his life. His wish is seemingly granted when a god reincarnates him in Madeus, a world trapped in a cycle of collapse. Hoping that Takeru's presence might finally save the world, the god grants him invaluable gifts: a new body with potent magic, a bottomless bag, and a skill that allows him to locate and appraise materials and treasures.\n\nThrust into a new adventure, Takeru begins his new life exploring freely and collecting valuables to sell. However, as he journeys alongside a newly hatched dragon, his quiet actions start to send ripples across the world—subtly changing its future toward the unseen.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
