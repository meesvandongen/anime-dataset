  "synopsis": "Seven years after the defeat of Majin Buu, Earth is at peace, and its people live free from any dangers lurking in the universe. However, this peace is short-lived; a sleeping threat awakens in the dark reaches of the galaxy: Beerus, the ruthless God of Destruction.\n\nDisturbed by a prophecy that he will be defeated by a \"Super Saiyan God,\" Beerus and his angelic attendant Whis search the universe for this mysterious being. Before long, they reach Earth and encounter Gokuu Son, one of the planet's mightiest warriors, and his powerful friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
