  "synopsis": "\"Capsules Project\" is a collection of domestically produced animated short films created by a professional team with mature animation production experience. With the creative theme of \"extreme emotions + independent themes,\" it does not restrict the creative form, exploring the possibilities of animation together with the team. The aim is to collaboratively create animated short films with diverse styles and characteristics, and to help Chinese animators reach the world stage. Just as there are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's hearts, this season's theme is \"Hero.\" Based on their chosen emotional combinations, the team will write their own story of a \"hero.\"\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
