  "synopsis": "Yuuki Aito is a perverted manga artist who appreciates panties, wishing to draw as many as he can. Being surrounded by numerous female assistants, he is constantly asking to use them as references for the manga he draws.\n \nAlthough Aito has an extremely degenerate mind, he can also be a very kind, generous, and helpful person. The duality of his behavior confuses his assistants—do they love the considerate side of him that he rarely displays, or do they hate him for the perverted thoughts he has most of the time?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
