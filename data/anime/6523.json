  "synopsis": "The curious penguin Pororo is out exploring one day when he stumbles upon a mysterious egg. Planning on eating it, Pororo decides to take it home. However, the egg hatches in front of his eyes, and to his surprise a dinosaur emerges, staring him in the face. Though terrified at first, Pororo soon befriends the lovable pint-sized creature and the two go on many adventures with the rest of their friends.\n\nWithin this gang of friends, there is the dinosaur Crong, a playful troublemaker; the fox Eddy, a trickster and inventor; the beaver Loopy, an artistic baker; and the polar bear Poby, a photographer and fisherman with a generous heart. When all these friends get together, they are sure to get into mischief.\n\nPorong Porong Pororo follows Pororo and his friends as they venture through their daily lives. Confronting every new adventure and challenge, Pororo and the gang will learn courage, compassion, and what it truly means to be a good friend.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
