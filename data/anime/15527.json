  "synopsis": "HIFANA's unique live performances and track-making skills have inspired club music fans around the globe. Their full-length album \"24H\" was released on July 28, 2010. Based on the concept of \"1 day : 24 hours,\" the album is made up of 12 audio tracks plus 12 video tracks featuring different events that occur throughout the day.\n\nHIFANA has always pursued an original musical style, which could be called \"Tokyo-born Japanese Hybrid Breakbeats,\" mixing various sounds with freestyle editing. In this album, they’ve transcended to another level, turning 12 fresh, tight tracks, led by \"HANABEAM,\" based on the explosive sounds of fireworks. Guest artists include UA, Spinna B-ILL, Twigy, Chinza Dopeness, Leyona, Yohei Miyake, Mitsuyoshi Azuma, and Keyco.\n\nThe DVD includes 12 videos, one for each track on the album. Over 15 up-and-coming visual creators contributed to the project with HIFANA and W+K Tokyo Lab’s partnership at the core, resulting in some intense collaborations.\n\nRefer to More Info section for details.\n\n(Source: Official website)",
