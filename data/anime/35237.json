  "synopsis": "It is the day of the school festival, and Junichi Hashiba and Yukana Yame's class cafe is doing well. During a break from her shift, Yukana hears an urban legend about the festival’s after-party. According to the tale, couples who share the last dance together will be lovers for the rest of their lives. Unfortunately, others catch on to this rumor and decide to separate Junichi and Yukana before they can dance. Will the two be able to stick together, or will someone else whisk them apart?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
