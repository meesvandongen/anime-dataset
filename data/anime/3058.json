  "synopsis": "Jun is a comic artist who is never afraid to put in a hard day of work. Naturally, he authors pornographic comics. He's been given a monumental deadline, but he has a special power allowing him to work at hyper speed as long as he is aroused. Lucky for him, his assistant Miyuki is also his wife and she's ready to give him a hand with work. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",
