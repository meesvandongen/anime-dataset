He was seriously injured, and when he was about to die, a nurse, Yamami Yu, helped him. \nHe was sent into an emergency ward, and he met a beautiful woman, Mikage Reika. She was a director of the hospital, and she asked him to become a test subject. Because he didn't have any relatives, he accepted it.
