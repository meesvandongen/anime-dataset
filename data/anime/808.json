  "synopsis": "The Sorcerer Hunters—brothers Carrot and Marron Glace, sisters Tira and Chocolate Misu, and warrior Gateau Mocha—decide to take a break from their travels, planning to stop by a hot springs resort and visit a local village festival. However, their hopes of a simple vacation are dashed by the appearance of a troublesome sorcerer.\n\nThroughout the group's escapades, Carrot's attempts at finding a woman to love are as desperate as ever. Chocolate and Tira make his search no easier, persistently thwarting his efforts with their aggressive displays of affection. Meanwhile, Mocha teaches his little sister how to do proper bodybuilding, and Marron does his best to remain pure amid the never-ending chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
