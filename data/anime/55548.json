  "synopsis": "Yumi works as an office manager for in-home tutors.  One day she receives a request for a tutor but the only available staff is Kouta whom Yumi considers worthless because of his nasty personality.  Kouta learns of this and forces Yumi to assign him to this request, by some unscrupulous means, as his work history is of always accomplishing his assignment.  Unfortunately, this means using anyway necessary, and this has led to a recent lawsuit against the company.\n\nThe request is to teach an acquaintance of Chiaki, the office chief, whose beautiful twin daughters, Kasumi and Mitsuki, have a shady history of all prior tutors requesting reassignment by pulling all kinds of practical jokes to get rid of them.  Kouta uses any compromising trick possible to force them to learn.",
