  "synopsis": "In an unassuming city, a deadly virus is released onto all its residents—but instead of being lethal, it skyrockets everyone's sex drive. The school near the virus' source is affected the worst: the teachers seek out the students, and the students fight each other to get to the teachers. The debauchery in the city is now at an all time high, and nothing can stand in these lustful people's way of reaching ultimate pleasure.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
