  "synopsis": "With the rapid advance of science and technology, artificial intelligence has gained sentience and become godlike beings. The capitalists on the top of the pyramid are not willing to yield to these \"Gods,\" so they conducted human experiments and embedded copies of the \"Gods\" in humans and obtained powers that could rival the \"Gods.\" Main character Feng Mo is the only survivor of these experiments. This story is about the symbiotic relationship between humans and artificial intelligence, and how they changed their fate in this world of despair.\n\n(Source: YouTube description, edited)",
