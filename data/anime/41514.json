  "synopsis": "After achieving fruitful results in New World Online's previous events, the now famous Maple Tree guild is excited to explore the new floors introduced in game. As if their guild was not already feared enough, each member is motivated to find stronger skills for themselves in order to greatly expand their options in future battles. Not forgetting the importance of networking, the guild also forges amicable relationships with other notable guilds, such as the Kingdom of the Flame Emperor and the Congregation of the Holy Swords.\n\nWith their eccentric guild master Maple at the forefront, the members of Maple Tree continue to stumble upon creative ways to implement their skills, driving the game developers crazy along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
