  "synopsis": "All his life, Yuuya Tenjou has been the subject of resentment and contempt from everyone around him, even from his parents. To make matters worse, his grandfather—the only person who ever showed him affection—suddenly dies, leaving Yuuya truly alone.\n\nDespite facing many adversities, Yuuya does what he can to offer kindness to those who need it—but even the most good-natured people can only tolerate so much abuse. Just when he reaches his breaking point, a flicker of hope appears in the form of a hidden door in his bathroom.\n\nThis door provides two-way access to an abandoned house in another world, where he instantly gains game-like stats and skills. Moreover, the house once belonged to a sage, which gives Yuuya access to remarkable weapons, equipment, and crops with extraordinary effects. With these newfound blessings, the once-undesirable Yuuya may just reach his true potential and become unstoppable.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
