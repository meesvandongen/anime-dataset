Having no fangs, fur, or scales, she was called \"Faceless,\" and she lived a lonely life with no one else she could identify with. \"I want to be part of the world...\" With such longing in her heart, she decides to set out on a journey to find her roots, carrying the Runding, a great sword as tall as she is. She doesn't know how many adversities await her along the way... \n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
