  "synopsis": "The girls of 765 Production Studio are eagerly preparing for the International Music Festival on Vacation Island. Coupled with an amusement park and a high-class resort, the festival promises several days of fun for everyone. That is, until their producer announces that they only have enough room for one unit to participate.\n\nIn three different scenarios where everyone is split into three groups, one of the three is chosen to partake in the International Music Festival, where they are treated to a three-day vacation before starring in the festival's concert. From the moment they step off the boat until the main event, each group of girls experiences the festival in their own way, excited to take part in the highly anticipated performance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
