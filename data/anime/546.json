There, he spent normal but happy school days with his sister, Hinata, a jokey classmate, Tachibana Tsutomu, Shikouin Kasumi, Tsutomu's childhood friend, and other friends.\n\nOne day, after school, Makoto heard someone playing the harmonica. That melody made him feel something old, and it brought him to the roof of the school buildings. There, he met a girl in the dusk.\n\nIt was Narukaze Minamo who turned her face to him with a smile. She was a childhood friend, but they had lived separately for years.\nHiding their true thoughts, Makoto and his friends spend their lives in school. Their stories in a mysterious town are about to begin.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
