  "synopsis": "In Shibuya, Tokyo in 2037, LayereD is a platform that uses mixed reality technology to create visualizations of the Internet in the real world. By using special devices, people can have various augmented-reality experiences. Users are able to bring things they imagine into the real world, allowing for a wide variety of self-expression. However, the system does not provide people the freedom it was supposed to, and people actually live in an oppressive society. In the Varna Counter system, harmful creations are eliminated in order to make LayereD \"completely clean and healthy.\" Because users monitor each other to maintain regulations, society becomes rigid and constrained.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
