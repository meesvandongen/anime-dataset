  "synopsis": "Word has it that whenever the sun enters a new solar cycle that there's a chance the so-called Aurora Pokémon, the legendary Pokémon Suicune itself, will make an appearance! Satoshi and Gou head toward Aurora Village as research fellows from the Sakuragi Laboratory in order to look into the connection between Suicune and the auroras. There, they meet a girl named Emma, whose father is an aurora researcher, as well as the many Pokémon who live out there in the snowy fields. But the Rocket-Dan appear before Satoshi and the others to get Pikachu! Will our heroes be able to reach the auroras and meet Suicune after all!?\n\n(Source: Dogasu's Backpack)",
