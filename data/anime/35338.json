  "synopsis": "For the production of their game's poolside scene, Blessing Software's illustrator Eriri Spencer Sawamura wants Megumi Katou to model in a swimsuit for her sketches of the game's heroine. However, Megumi refuses to wear such attire unless everyone else agrees to do the same. To ensure the development of their game continues smoothly, the team follows her request as they conduct their fruitful research at a luxury hotel.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
