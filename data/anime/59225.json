  "synopsis": "Let's traverse the desert in the clouds together, heading to the starting point of heroes' dreams: Jixia Academy! After the Return to the Void Dream Performance, Yao, the passionate and somewhat eccentric captain of the Star Team, didn't want the team to disband. He wanted to continue engaging in team activities at school to strengthen team cohesion, and he came up with a brilliant idea… to accept various requests during their spare time. \n\nIn the process of solving one bizarre incident after another, the members of the Star Team deepened their bonds. The Star Team officially became the \"Always-Awaited Star Team\"—\"The Star Team is on the move, and it's done in no time!\"\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",
