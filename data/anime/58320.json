  "synopsis": "\"Let's go. In search of treasure\"\nNike, a punky outsider girl, runs through the city of the future! In a city where the transportation infrastructure has developed dramatically and walking is no longer necessary, Nike runs alone in her favorite sneakers. Her goal is to get sneakers from the legendary manufacturer \"Dynameros\", which can only be obtained on the black market. As Nike runs despite being chased by a horde of cyber police, a woman appears in front of her. That woman is none other than Sherry, the daughter of the president of \"Fractal Walter\", a major company that created the era. What kind of story will the encounter between these two opposing people produce?\n\n(Source: Official site, translated)",
