However, his parents suddenly disappeared without a trace, the family company was seized by his father's former assistant, and even the villa he had lived in since childhood was taken over by so-called creditors. Forced to temporarily reside in the Lin family's old mansion in the suburbs, Lin Chu was surprised to find mysterious voices emanating from a bonsai tree in the courtyard. He unexpectedly entered the bonsai and discovered a sacred mountain and an immortal—Xuanqing Patriarch—sealed within. Xuanqing Patriarch realized Lin Chu possessed the ability to break the seal and decided to take him as a disciple, teaching him cultivation methods so he can break the seal. At the same time, to repay Lin Chu, Xuanqing Patriarch also agreed to teach him some skills to help him investigate the truth behind his parents' disappearance. Lin Chu agreed to Xuanqing Patriarch's request and thus embarked on the path of cultivation!\n\n(Source: Youku, translated)",
