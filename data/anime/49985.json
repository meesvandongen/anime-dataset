  "synopsis": "The story rewinds thirteen years, recounting the massacre of the entire He family, except for the young He Fangzhi, at a mutton soup restaurant in the Gobi Desert. Those involved in the massacre are familiar faces He Fangzhi encounters thirteen years later seeking revenge: Luo Tong, Hong Niang, the Unjust Monk, Long Shun, and Uncle Jian. This nighttime killing exposes the hidden beliefs and personal motives of each member of the murder squad, culminating in Uncle Jian's agonizing choice between \"family and country\" and \"loyalty and duty\"... In this carnage, will they truly achieve their goals? Is Uncle Jian's choice worthwhile...?\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",
