  "synopsis": "DVD specials of Kirakira Shougakusei Celeb-chan. These were 'original draft' episodes. As in, these episodes were created for the TV broadcast but were either cut entirely or their concepts were extremely reworked. For example, Celeb-chan's toy poodle rather than being an aggressive small dog, is portrayed as a large-bodied  severely inbred dog for most of these specials.",
