  "synopsis": "Descended from a long line of book collectors, high school student Mifuyu is surrounded by books in every aspect of her life. Her great-grandfather established the famous Mikura Hall, a library in the heart of town, and even the townspeople are all avid readers. There's just one problem—Mifuyu hates books! But when a thief in Mikura Hall triggers an ancient curse, she's left with no choice but to reclaim the stolen books herself...by entering the very stories she despises! With the help of the mysterious Mashiro, will she be able to restore her great-grandfather's collection and save her town from a magical doom?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
