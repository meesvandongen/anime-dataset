  "synopsis": "A divine master accidentally fell into the mortal realm, losing all his magical powers. He'd spent millennia trying to unlock the secrets of ascension, only to discover that the first step was to return to earth, starting all over again! The divine master had intended to emulate other cultivators and plunge into arduous cultivation, but who could have imagined that a chef, appearing out of nowhere, would unexpectedly unlock a new path for him to \"level up through food.\" Having lived on spiritual energy and dew since childhood, when had the noble divine master of the Ninth Heaven ever encountered such down-to-earth human delicacies? He loved to eat, to eat more, and to fight over the food! It wasn't until he'd collected every delicacy in the world, with those kneeling before him in submission, that the divine master realized: I'd eaten myself into invincibility!\n\n(Source: iQIYI, Google translated)",
