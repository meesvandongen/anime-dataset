As a result of his father's death, he left the Italian monastery where he'd been training and rightfully took the name \"Natsume Kiroemon\" as well as the power of the Kiryuu no Mimi.

Now Natsume has unlocked the seal, making the Kiryuu's power surge, and he's striking back at the Mina family.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
