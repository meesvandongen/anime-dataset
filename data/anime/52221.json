  "synopsis": "There are many dynasties in Yongxian Continent. In order to strengthen the body and prolong life, the people here have always maintained the tradition of Xianwu fellow practitioners. Once the practitioners reach the peak of martial arts, they will ask about Xiandao. The young Su Yu, who suffered a severe accident at a young age, changed his name and changed his surname, but he was still in a hurry, but he was unexpectedly reborn back to his youth. Foreseeing that the family is about to fall, in order to protect his family and relatives, Su Yu decided to work hard and practice the secret methods of Xianmen he learned in his previous life.\n\n(Source: iqiyi.com)",
