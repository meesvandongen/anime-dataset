  "synopsis": "Real-life former SKE48 idol Airi Furukawa stars as herself, Airin, in a self made short manga she draws. The anime adaptation of her manga features odd characters such as a bewitched stuff bear and others named after mushrooms. The work is full of cuteness, laughs, and bizarre nonsense bordering surrealness.",
