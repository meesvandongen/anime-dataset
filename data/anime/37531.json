  "synopsis": "With its pitch-black wings spread wide and a fragile note in its mouth, a crow delivers a task to a young female spirit. Her job has always been to give people the final push to suicide, and this one is just like all the rest. Though jaded, she continues to perform her duty, as much as it tears her apart inside. However, when one of her victims is saved by a young man, her world shines brighter. But even this joy might be destroyed when he begins to show signs of despair...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
