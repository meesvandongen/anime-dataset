  "synopsis": "On her way home, kindhearted high school student Akira Masaki is whisked away to another world full of magic. Those who can wield it are called wizards, and some are chosen to fight against the Great Calamity annually. Although battling the catastrophe was manageable in the past, it has become so powerful that it has claimed many lives.\n\nIn the midst of all the chaos, the Great Sage has the power to guide the chosen wizards in the combat against the Great Calamity—a role that has been passed to Akira. Even though the girl desires to return home, she agrees to stay with the surviving wizards and help them find their new comrades scattered across five countries. Akira must now convince them to join the cause and lead the group against the imminent evil.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
