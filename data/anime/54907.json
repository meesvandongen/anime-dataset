  "synopsis": "Gay high school student Masaki Michishita is making a desperate rush to the bathroom, not remembering that the park he has wandered into is a popular spot for men to meet each other for hookups. When he encounters the handsome Takakazu Abe, who immediately propositions him, Masaki forgets all about why he entered the park in the first place and seizes this opportunity for romance. However, nature's calling cannot be ignored; after Abe offers a unique solution to Masaki's problem, their bizarre, romantic, and sometimes even dangerous relationship begins.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
