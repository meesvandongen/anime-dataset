  "synopsis": "Despite being one of Zebrudia's few level 8 treasure hunters and the leader of the capital's top party, Grieving Souls, Krai Andrey does not deserve his prominent reputation. Everything he says somehow turns prophetic, which convinces everyone around him that he possesses unfathomable wisdom regardless of his utter incompetence. Krai knows his success is only a series of coincidences, but the weight of those expectations grows heavier as time goes by. Unfortunately, as the other members of the Grieving Souls continue to shock the world with their achievements, Krai's wish for a peaceful retirement drifts ever further out of reach.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
