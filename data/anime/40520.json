  "synopsis": "On the surface, Shiina Chizuru is a proper (albeit a bit uptight) schoolgirl. Her sharp tongue and a sense of morality have gotten her in trouble with her peers and teachers on more than one occasion. Additionally, she carries a secret crush on one of her teachers, a young and dashing Tsukino.\n\nAfter accidentally getting involved in an incident involving embezzling school funds, however, she finds herself at the mercy of her fat middle-aged teacher Tamura.\n\nHow far is she willing to go to protect her beloved Tsukino-sensei? And how much of her “proper girl” facade is just an act hiding a really perverted girl?\n\n(Source: FAKKU)",
