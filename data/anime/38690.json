  "synopsis": "When the emperor patrols the ocean, Crown Prince Jianwen witnesses a shocking scene: Admiral Zheng, whom he has been treating as both his teacher and a dear friend, suddenly kills the emperor. He is devastated when he finds out he is being framed by the imperial court for killing his own father in an attempted coup. Admiral Zheng accepts the order of Prince Regent Yan to return to Quanzhou and seize Jianwen. Jianwen sees through their plan and sets foot on an escape journey. At the time, all the forces inside and outside the imperial court were eager to move. How can Admiral Zheng continue to protect Jianwen, whose misunderstanding about him only deepens, and investigate the truth about the late emperor being enchanted?\n\n(Source: iQIYI)",
