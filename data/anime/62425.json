  "synopsis": "\"You bought me for 50 sacks of rice? Why would you do that?\"\n\n\"I thought you might end up dead if I didn't.\"\n\nHidden deep in the mountains from prying eyes, the burly Bong-chun lives in seclusion.\n\nBong-chun buys and rescues Sun-gap, a servant boy who is beaten almost to death by his master. Sun-gap is bewildered by Bong-chun, who treats him with unexpected kindness, calling him his wife and not putting him to any hard work.\n\nAs Sun-gap begins to enjoy the peace with Bong-chun, feeling relieved to have finally escaped his old master's house, a man appears, claiming he has come to take him back.\n\n(Source: Laftel)",
