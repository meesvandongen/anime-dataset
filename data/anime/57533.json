  "synopsis": "Following a bad experience teaching at a public high school that resulted in a break from working, Haruaki Abe eagerly takes up a new job at Hyakki Academy. Despite his cowardice, the novice teacher is motivated to do better this time around. However, his mind quickly changes when he finds out that everyone at the school is actually a supernatural being known as a youkai, leaving him glaringly out of place as the only human around.\n\nFacing his class as its new homeroom teacher, Abe immediately becomes a target for the students' antics due to his quick-to-scare nature. Though as the man starts to learn more about the creatures, as well as himself, getting along with the unruly group might not be as hard as he originally thought as their school lives begin to get more vibrant.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
