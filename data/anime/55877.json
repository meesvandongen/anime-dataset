  "synopsis": "Private detective Sousuke Kaburaya is simply trying to make ends meet when Sara da Odin, an imperial princess from another world, falls through a portal right on top of him. Unaware that she is an anomaly in a magicless world, Sara uses powerful spells in public, causing a commotion and forcing Sousuke to take her back home with him. With the help of the internet, manga, and modern Japanese conveniences, Sara grows accustomed to living in Japan and becomes Sousuke's assistant in the process.\n\nMeanwhile, Livia de Udis, Sara's personal knight, also comes through the portal but lands at a different location. There, she meets a homeless man who readily accepts her unique background and odd tendencies. Despite her situation, Livia quickly adapts and settles into the homeless lifestyle, a far cry from the noble position she used to hold.\n\nWhile Sara and Livia may be living different lives, their positive and ambitious attitudes leave a lasting impact on the people around them as they experience both the good and bad of Japan.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
