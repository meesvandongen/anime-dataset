  "synopsis": "In order to rescue Qili, Jianwen and others decided to go to the Axia ship. On the Axia, they encountered the female pirate Qisha, and rescued Qili with difficulties. However, Qili could not leave Jianwen because of the fate of his family. Just when Jianwen was hesitant, the news of King Yan's accession to the throne came, and the Haizangzhu appeared, and a martial arts competition was to be held on the Axia. In order to take revenge, Jianwen made up his mind to obtain the power of Haizangzhu and began to train hard to prepare for the competition. At this time, the conspiracy of Onmyoji and others to resurrect the evil god also emerged one after another. Jianwen battled wits and courage with Onmyoji and others on the Axia. On the other hand, the arrival of the Whale Riding Merchant Group Tongque brought new news to Qisha. Jianwen may be the \"destined person\" to unravel this series of conspiracies. Where will the story of Jianwen and others go?\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
