  "synopsis": "This work tells the legendary life of Megumi Sunahara, a Chinese People's Liberation Army soldier of Japanese descent, introducing the true history of this little-known special group of PLA members of Japanese descent. He was born in Kyushu, Japan in 1933, and came to Northeast China with his parents when he was young. After Japan's defeat and surrender, he was unable to return to Japan and lived in a landlord's house in Liaoning herding cattle. In 1948, Megumi Sunahara joined the PLA under the name \"Zhang Rongqing\", and he experienced the Liaoshen and Pingjin campaigns and devoted himself to the proletarian revolutionary cause while contributing to other battles in the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
