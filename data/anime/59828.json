  "synopsis": "\"I just wanted to know... what love really is.\"\n\nHaving ended their mutually beneficial reciprocal relationship, second-year high schoolers Jougorou Kobato and Yuki Osanai go their separate ways.\n\nOsanai begins dating first-year newspaper club member Uriuno, who throws himself into covering a series of arson incidents happening around town in hopes of leaving a mark on the school and impressing Osanai. Meanwhile, Kobato starts a relationship with his classmate, Nakamaru, and settles into a peaceful daily life—until he happens to witness an arson scene by the riverside...\n\nWhat awaits Kobato and Osanai as they embark on a new chapter of their lives as \"ordinary citizens\"?\n\n(Source: Official website, translated)",
