  "synopsis": "On his way to a convenience store, Kazuya Shiina tries to defend two young girls from an armed assailant, only to end up getting stabbed himself and dying on the spot. This good deed allows him to be reborn with all his memories in another world as Cain von Silford, the third son of a margrave.\n\nWhen Cain turns five, a baptismal ceremony in the church grants him an audience to the seven gods who preside over the world. Not only do the gods fill him in on the circumstances of his reincarnation, but they also give Cain their respective divine protections—allowing him to use cheat-like abilities in swordsmanship, magic, and many other aspects.\n\nWith these blessings, Cain sets out to live a fulfilling life that he deems a dream come true. However, it soon becomes clear that the gods have more plans for him than just a haphazard bestowal of overwhelming power.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
