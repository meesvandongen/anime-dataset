  "synopsis": "As the night falls, the curtains of the Kraevif Theater rise slowly, and the talented host Arnold Krebreg steps onto the stage, ready to present a self made puppet show. On the theater's grand stage sits a small stage for the puppets. As soon as Arnold places the puppets within, they spontaneously come to life, beginning their improvisational performances. What might the fan letters from the puppets contain? Why does a fragrant signature dish lead to chaos? In an unusually intense soccer match, the score difference reaches...?! More exciting stories await at the Krakow Theater! The capricious and lively Joker, the narcissistic and grumpy Leo, and the self-absorbed and clueless Bane, along with other residents of the manor, will join hands to showcase a series of fantastic and joyful daily routines for the audience.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",
