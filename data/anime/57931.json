  "synopsis": "As the first Chinese animated film to feature Zhu Bajie as the protagonist, it focuses on developing the character's growth and transformation. Compared to traditional Chinese animated heroes often portrayed as rebellious, Zhu Bajie has always been a controversial and talked-about character. While gluttonous, lazy, and somewhat selfish, he also possesses his own bottom line and principles, making him a flawed yet warm-hearted man.\n\nThe film also explores the love story between Zhu Bajie and his first love, \"Sister Egg\" from the Yunzhan Cave in Fuling Mountain, further highlighting Zhu Bajie's loyal and affectionate character. Their \"beauty and the beast\"-like encounter, though beautiful and fleeting, evokes tears for their sincere love.\n\n(Source: Douban, translated)",
