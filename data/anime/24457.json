  "synopsis": "What do Ryouma Echizen and the Seishun Academy Boys' Tennis Team get up to when they are off the court? They are pranking each other with a creepy kokeshi doll in the locker room and incorrectly dressing up for Halloween, just to name a few. With cameos from rival school players to add to the hilarity, Houkago no Oujisama explores life outside of the sport that makes these characters tick.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
