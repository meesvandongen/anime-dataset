  "synopsis": "Lord Haven watches over a secluded village in the realm of Djana En. Redon, his son, feels unsatisfied with his tranquil yet dull life of assisting the townsfolk in their labor. When his parents are suddenly assassinated, Redon must flee the village with a handful of companions. As the group is cornered at the edge of \"God's Wall,\" the mystical snakeskin that seals off Djana En from the rest of the world, a voice beckons to Redon. It urges him to enter a fresh opening in the wall and travel to the fabled land of Crystania, where he can obtain incredible power.\n\nWithout any other options, Redon and his comrades escape through the mysterious passage, only to find a Crystania far different than how the legends picture it. Faced with danger and shape-shifting beastmen, Redon and his party wonder if they stumbled into someplace worse than where they came from. Things take a favorable turn, however, when the group meets a pair of travelers knowledgeable about the tumultuous state of Crystania.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
