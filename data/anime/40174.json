  "synopsis": "The Franchouchou girls are back and better than ever! Unfortunately for them, they are also heavily in debt. After a concert bombs, the undead members are forced to take day jobs to pay off the venue, and their normally eccentric manager, Koutarou Tatsumi, sinks into alcoholism.\n\nBut dark days cannot keep these idols down! Rival idols appear, a famous talk show host retires, and existentialism takes root. Koutarou's legacy will slowly unravel while a journalist closes in on the truth. As Saga plunges into chaos, Franchouchou may realize being dead is the least of their worries—but at least the legendary Tae Yamada gets even more legendary!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
