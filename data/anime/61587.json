  "synopsis": "Flum Apricot was never meant to be a hero. Despite zero stats across the board and a power she can't even use, she somehow finds herself included in a party of heroes. But Flum's life hits rock bottom when the party's renowned sage, Jean Inteige, decides that the useless girl is dead weight, and arranges to have her sold into slavery. Tossed to monsters to be feasted upon for her master's entertainment, Flum makes the desperate choice to reach for a cursed weapon... and something new awakens within her. A grimdark tale about one woman's blood-soaked quest to reclaim her life!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
