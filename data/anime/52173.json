  "synopsis": "Kind-hearted Himuro-kun is unfortunate: when in deep concentration, stressed, or flustered, he involuntarily creates blizzard conditions for himself and anyone in his vicinity. During one such incident on the first day of his new job, Himuro-kun encounters the beautiful Fuyutsuki-san, who helps him break out of his nerve-induced ice. As it turns out, Fuyutsuki-san is his new coworker.\n\nAt the office, the cool-headed Fuyutsuki-san offers simple and rational solutions to Himuro-kun's icy dilemmas—everything from helping him garden without freezing his plants to ensuring he does not melt during their tropical work retreat. Every time Fuyutsuki-san does something kind for him, the tempest of emotions he experiences inside embarrassingly manifests on the outside.\n\nAs a result of the frequent snowstorms, Himuro-kun's feelings for Fuyutsuki-san are impossible to hide. Even though Fuyutsuki-san is unfamiliar with love, Himuro-kun remains determined to repay her kindness and warm her heart in any way he can.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
