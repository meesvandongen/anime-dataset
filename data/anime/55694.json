  "synopsis": "In ancient times, saints fought for hegemony. A young man known as the \"Sleeping God\" turned out to be a blessing in disguise and opened up a heaven-defying skill. From then on, a genius with unparalleled physical strength dominated the world, slashed the stars with his sword, and thousands of geniuses crawled and trembled under his feet. In a world where heroes are rising, I am the only one who dominates.\n\n(Source: Youku, translated)",
