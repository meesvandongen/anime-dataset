  "synopsis": "In the lead-up to a photoshoot in which Yua Nakabeni and Ren Aikawa have been invited to model for an illustrator, the two girls are feeling anxious. To help them out, their friend and fellow classmate Homi Moegi decides to run a practice shoot in hopes of easing their nerves.\n\nYua and Ren repeatedly tense up during shots on their own, so Homi asks them to pair up for some couple shots, hoping that they will relax in each other's company. What begins as a series of cute poses soon turns into an alluring collage of legs encased in black stockings layered over one another.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
