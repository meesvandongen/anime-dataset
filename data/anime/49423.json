  "synopsis": "The phantom thief known as the Mirage Queen is an enigma. From their age and gender to the methods behind their daring heists, much remains unknown to authorities and investigators worldwide. However, Queen's few accomplices know them as a remarkably principled person, guided by an internal code and a belief in the artistry of theft. As Queen announces their next target—the legendary jewel called Rose of Linden—the public holds its breath in anticipation. But when thieves from a traveling circus claim the jewel first, it sparks a contest of deception that promises to take everyone involved by surprise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
