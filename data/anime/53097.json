  "synopsis": "After a successful showdown at Tokyo Tower, the Mew Mew girls enjoy a temporary respite. Now that Ichigo Momomiya and Masaya Aoyama have confessed their feelings to each other, Ichigo is overjoyed to spend time with her new boyfriend. However, their quick break gets interrupted, and soon the girls must battle against the Chimera Anima yet again. When things go awry in the ensuing fight, Ichigo is placed in grave danger.\n\nJust when things look most bleak, the mysterious Blue Knight arrives and saves Ichigo, proclaiming that he was born to protect her, before disappearing into thin air. With the fate of the world on their shoulders and the identity of the Blue Knight in question, the Mew Mew girls must strive to create balance between alien-fighting and their personal lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
