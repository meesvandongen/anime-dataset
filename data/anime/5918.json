  "synopsis": "Trapped in a dark abyss, the once-beautiful Venus is rotting in her own despair. Unhappy with her fate, she calls on her twin brother Deimos to find her a new body.\n\nMeanwhile, Minako Ifu is in a predicament, as her friend Hisamatsu has gone missing while searching for a master orchid grower. On her way to locate him, she encounters Deimos—who declares that she will become his bride and return to the underworld with him. Fleeing in disgust, Minako discovers the house her friend was pursuing and meets the endearing siblings Touko and Kaname Ooba.\n\nHowever, the situation is not as it seems, and Minako quickly becomes entangled in a nefarious affair—all while being followed by the charming Deimos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
