  "synopsis": "Picking up where season one left off, Juzo Inui (Gun Slave Unit Device 13) has Rosa's data. Although it seems like everyone wants it, either to expose it or to destroy it, really no one is interested in it. Wachowski, the leader of the anti-Extended terrorist organization Spitzbergen, attempts to coerce Tetsurō to use Harmony to command Juzo to destroy Gun Slave Unit Device 7, who works for Berühren. Juzo does eventually fight Seven, but -- between corruption and double-crosses -- Berühren still pulls all the strings.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
