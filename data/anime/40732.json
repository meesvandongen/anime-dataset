  "synopsis": "After Wuxin left, Xiao Se and Lei Wujie arrived in Xueyue City. Third Lord Sikong Changfeng recognized Xiao Se and insisted on taking him in as his disciple. Lei Wujie challenged the Dengtian Chamber and requested to see Second Lord, the Xueyue Sword Deity Li Hanyi. He wanted Li Hanyi to go to the Lei Faction and visit his master, Lei Hong. The two of them made a deal. If Lei Wujie could survive three sword moves from Li Hanyi, Li would go with him. Several months later, Lei Wujie became highly skilled in martial arts and successfully endured Li Hanyi’s three sword moves. Li Hanyi kept her promise and left the mountain. As Xiao Se entered Xueyue City, the other princes of Tianqi became restless as well. They started to search for allies one after another. A scheme against Xueyue City is currently brewing. \n\n(Source: Youku)",
