  "synopsis": "Aki Shiina has always been perceived as a girl because of his feminine appearance. Wishing to change himself and forget his past, he moves to a dorm and enrolls in a middle school in Tokyo.\n\nArriving at his new home, Aki is welcomed warmly by the dorm's caretaker, Ayaka Sunohara, who immediately takes a liking to him. But he soon finds out that all of his new roommates are girls from the student council! The girls often tease Aki, seeing him as very girlish. However, still determined to become more masculine, Aki tries his best to help the people around him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
