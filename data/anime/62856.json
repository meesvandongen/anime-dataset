  "synopsis": "In an alternate version of the early 20th-century, where steam power developed rapidly and progress has now stagnated—Kyoto is shrouded in soot, smoke, and steam.\n\nKihachi Sakamoto, a skeptical boy, is haunted by the loss of his brother with whom he once dreamed of an \"Age of Electricity.\" Inako Momokawa, a deeply spiritual girl, feels forced to hide both her dreams and her regrets for her late mother. When Inako crosses paths with Kihachi, their encounter creates a spark that propels them to challenge a new era, with the 20th Century Electric Catalogue as their guide: a mysterious and visionary record full of secrets that could reshape the world.\n\nTo move beyond who they are now and reclaim the dreams they once held—this is a story of renewal.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
