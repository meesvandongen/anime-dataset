The short on an outdoor screen near the main Yabaton shop and the main voice actor Fukushi Ochiai, who voices Buu-chan, will attend the premiere. \n\nThe short follows the shy and kind-hearted Buu-chan and his unusual family as they get into both slapstick and heartwarming situations. \n\nYabaton serves Nagoya's regionally famous street food, misokatsu, a pork cutlet in miso sauce, as well as other fried foods. The chain has many locations but its main shop is located is Yaba-cho in Nagoya city (specifically the Osu Shopping District) where it can be easily spotted thanks to its towering mascot. \n\n(Source: ANN)",
