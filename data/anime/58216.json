  "synopsis": "Once admired as the strongest swordsman of the empire, Ascheriit is betrayed and brutally killed by seven of his brothers-in-arms after defeating the evil forces of Wischtech. Twenty years later, Ascheriit's name has fallen into infamy while his murderers are now admired everywhere and dubbed as the Seven Heroes.\n \nHowever, Ascheriit returns from the dead as a half-elf named Köinzell with only one goal in mind: to take revenge on his old companions. Soon joined by new allies who share his thirst for justice, Köinzell will stop at nothing to expose the crimes of the Seven Heroes and find ultimate solace.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
