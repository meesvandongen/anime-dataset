  "synopsis": "Thunder and fire kill people, rumors spread, and rat-faced sinister soldiers rampage across the imperial capital. Everything seems to point to the secrets of the former dynasty that were wiped out by thunder and fire. A pair of hands brought three very different young men together. Jing Yifei, the cold and proud female master of Jinwu Guard, was ordered to find out the truth about the rat soldiers. Bai Qi, the descendant of Jieyi who lives in seclusion in the mountains, led his master to go down the mountain to find a young machine master to join the Jinwu Guard. But the person he was looking for, Qin Ming, was deceiving and abducting him!? As the three of them continued to work together, they gradually came closer to the truth about Lei Huo.\n\n(Source: iq.com)",
