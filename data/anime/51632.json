  "synopsis": "Touya Mochizuki grows accustomed to his new life in another world. Armed with his trusty smartphone, the teenager accepts small quests at his leisure while spending time with his new fiancées: Yumina Urnea Belfast, Yae Kokonoe, and twin sisters Linse and Elze Shileska. But even in a relaxing environment, Touya is only beginning to understand the responsibilities that come with these engagements.\n\nIn addition to his romantic woes, the elder fairy Lean wishes to locate the remaining pieces of Babylon, the floating island that the mysterious Professor Regina Babylon created five thousand years ago. Touya reluctantly accepts her request and seeks out the teleportation circles that will lead to the islands. However, strange monsters have emerged—possibly powerful enough to destroy the world. In order to save the second life he was given, Touya must weaponize ancient technologies to fight these monsters—all while balancing his overwhelming number of relationships.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
