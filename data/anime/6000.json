  "synopsis": "In a violent post-apocalyptic Japan, a reckless juvenile delinquent named Haruwo takes on the Yakuza, but their new bouncer may be more than he can handle... \n\nOver a year in the making, this half-hour short was entirely the work of one person--even the music! \"Haruwo\" animator Shao Guee writes, \"I didn't make this film for money, just for fun. I hope people all over the world will have a chance to see it. If you like it, please tell your friends about it. That's all I want. My thanks to everyone who helped me make this project a reality.\"",
