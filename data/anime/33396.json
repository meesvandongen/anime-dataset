  "synopsis": "The story takes place at the end of the Tang Dynasty, a time of political turmoil and widespread fear among both the court and the common people. The mysterious \"Bu Liang Ren,\" an organization affiliated with the government, has vanished without a trace, along with the priceless treasures of the national treasury. Legend has it that all secrets are hidden within the Longquan Sword, and whoever possesses it will have the power to control the world. \n\nLi Xingyun, orphaned at a young age, was adopted by the kind hermit Yang Shuzi and trained under his tutelage. Years passed, and Li Xingyun grew into a spirited young man. He and his fellow disciple Lu Linxuan descended the mountain to hone their skills, where they met Ji Ruxue and Zhang Zifan. By chance, Li Xingyun obtained the Longquan Sword, a piece of news that quickly spread, alerting various sects. They dispatched assassins to track Li Xingyun and his companions, attempting to steal the Longquan Sword.\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",
