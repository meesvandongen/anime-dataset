  "synopsis": "When the Neighbor's Club struggles to find an activity to do, Kodaka Hasegawa suggests they pass the time by writing a round-robin story—a narrative where everyone takes turns writing a section. But as they begin the project, chaos ensues as every member writes the story according to their personal preferences while trying to outdo each other. At this rate, will the story ever reach a fitting conclusion?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
