  "synopsis": "A 2-disc OVA series created for businesses under the supervision of two lawyers. It's main goal is to be a scandal prevention tool. The focus is scandals in a work environment, as in how they happen and how supervisors are to handle the situation. \n\nDisc 1 covers voyeurism (mainly taking up-skirt photos of school girls in public places), stalking, drunk driving, and illegal drug use. \n\nDisc 2 handles embezzlement, IP theft, and maternity harassment/pregnancy discrimination (a common issue in Japan where women are bullied into quitting when seeking maternity leave. Some women receive this harassment in the form of being passed over for promotions even when not pregnant/without kids because they might one day become pregnant in the future). \n\nSome topics deal cover two versions of the issue. Such as IP theft on purpose (someone selling company information) and IP theft by accident (losing a USB full of data on a train with company information).",
