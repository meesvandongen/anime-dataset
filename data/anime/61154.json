  "synopsis": "In the special pre-movie footage released, we see Bullish Katarina, Weak Katarina, Happy Katarina, and Chairman Katarina, who often hold meetings in Katarina's head in the TV series, quickly heading to the movie theater. The girls arrived on time for the screening, grabbed some popcorn, put their cell phones and smartphones on silent mode, and were all set to watch the movie, when a serious Katarina appeared on the screen and said, \"Your seats are over here!!\" Of course, it was revealed that the meeting will continue to take place in Katarina's head in this movie version as well.\n\n(Source: Official Website)",
