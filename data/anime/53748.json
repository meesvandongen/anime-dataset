However, in order for Seiya and the other four Bronze Saints to reach the Pope's Chamber, they must break through the Twelve Palaces protected by the Golden Saints. There are five more palaces waiting for them to reach the Pope's Chamber. Can Seiya and his team defeat the powerful enemies that stand in their way and reach the Pope's Chamber, where the shocking truth is hidden?\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
