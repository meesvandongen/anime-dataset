  "synopsis": "A nonsensical, hilarious animated film! There's a boy with the magical ability to cure all diseases, but his method of healing is by hitting people. There's also a girl who seems physically weak, but can suddenly develop explosive muscles, creating an adorable contrast. And then there's a monster who dreams of becoming the strongest. This quirky trio embarks on a magical journey full of surprises. It's guaranteed to make you laugh until your abs and V-line are aching!\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",
