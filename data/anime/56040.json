  "synopsis": "This story not only depicts the daily lives of the Great Wall Guards and the Protectorate, but also showcases life in the Cloud Desert from the perspectives of characters from different factions. Whether it's the Great Wall Guards stationed on the frontier, the caravans robbing the rich to help the poor, the ancient people whose hometowns have been desolate for centuries, or the down-on-his-luck prince wandering far from home, everyone has their own territory to protect—to safeguard peaceful lives, to protect each other's dreams, to protect lost cultures, to protect the people of their homeland… While one person's strength may be limited, their shared belief in protecting each other makes them invincible. It is this belief that allows these originally strangers to appreciate and cherish each other, gaining a \"precious treasure\" that transcends material possessions.\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",
