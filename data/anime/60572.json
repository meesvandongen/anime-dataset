When he woke up, he found himself reincarnated into a young man named \"Liu Fengmang\" who is imprisoned in the White Mansion. \n\nHis sect, Lingxiao Pavilion, was also in dire straits. In order to find out the truth about the backlash of the spirit Kun and revive his sect, Fan Lingxiao takes his existing spirit pets and embarks on a new adventure with Gu Ling, Cheng Xi, and Yue Tong.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
