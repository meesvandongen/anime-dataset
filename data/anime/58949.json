  "synopsis": "Growing up can be tough, especially when you're a family of bears and your younger brother is a bit of a wild animal. Luckily Tish has a ridiculously huge imagination and a larger than life, imaginary friend Tash. No matter what troubles they face, be it tackling the age-old terror of boredom or maybe just helping your baby brother not to be sad about losing his favorite toy; Together they can create new worlds around themselves, embarking on imaginative adventures and finding their own creative angle to help solve any problems that life throws at them.\n\n(Source: WelCon)",
