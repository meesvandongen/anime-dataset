  "synopsis": "When Genji Kamishiro, the leader of Custos, tricks several Attractors into entering his custody, the conflict between Custos and the Attractors reaches a boiling point. Willing to take risks they would not dare otherwise, a few Attractors break into the Custos headquarters in hopes of rescuing their companions. Elsewhere, Quon Mitsuchi discovers the true nature of Kamishiro's plans and how his long-lost brother came to be encased in the crystal known as the Tears of Time. As their struggle reaches its apex, it remains unclear whether the future will be one of peace or destruction.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
