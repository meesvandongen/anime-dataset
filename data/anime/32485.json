  "synopsis": "Hachimitsu Private Academy's five male students have been released from their oppressive prison captors, allowing them to return to their ideal school lives surrounded by short-skirted girls.\n\nWith their freedom restored, things could not be going better for the gang. Kiyoshi Fujino and Shingo Wakamoto have formed close bonds with their female classmates; Reiji Andou is the center of attention due to his masochistic quirks; and even Takehito \"Gakuto\" Morokuzu—notorious for defecating himself during class—befriends the klutzy yet like-minded Mitsuko Yokoyama. \n\nHowever, in contrast to his fellow ex-convicts, Jouji \"Joe\" Nezu struggles to readjust to student life, and the unlikely romantic success of his friend Gakuto pushes him to his wit's end. Feeling ostracized, he begins to wonder if life was better behind bars.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
