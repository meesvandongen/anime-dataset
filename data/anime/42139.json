  "synopsis": "Tomorrow is a very special day because you'll be able to see a total eclipse of the sun! If you miss this opportunity, then it'll be more than 300 years before you get a chance to see another one in the Alola Region! When Satoshi hears this, he decides to go with Mamane to Eclipse Island, the central spot to see the solar event. There, they meet a \"Solar Eclipse Hunter\" named Fred who travels around the world chasing after solar eclipses. They decide to watch it with him, but, unfortunately, the weather is a bit cloudy on the actual day of the eclipse. Satoshi and his friends, thinking they'll definitely be able to see the eclipse from above the clouds, decide to head toward the top of a mountain to get a better view.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rocket-Dan hear that rare Pokemon are said to appear during the solar eclipse and, thinking they can also capture Pikachu while they're at it, sneak away from Kiteruguma's nest and hurry to the top of the mountain to confront Satoshi and his friends. During the conflict, however, the solar eclipse starts without them! Will Satoshi and his friends be able to watch the solar eclipse after all?\n\nUse your full power to not miss the miraculous moment when the sun and moon perform their special dance!\n\n(Source: Dogasu's Backpack)",
