  "synopsis": "The Fujimi Orchestra is thrilled when they manage to hire the brilliant Kei Tonoin as a conductor. However, his intense style and demands leave him clashing with some members, particularly the concertmaster, Yuuki Morimura. As each rehearsal further escalates these tensions, the orchestra seems in danger of being torn apart. However, these clashing attitudes conceal deeper feelings that are not as easy to solve as a mere conflict among musicians.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
