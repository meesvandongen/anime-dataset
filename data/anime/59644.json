  "synopsis": "Lufas Maphaahl, the Black-Winged Tyrant, was the Great Conqueror who once forged the world of Exgate into a single country. Her reign, supposedly one of fear, ended only when seven heroes rose to cast her down, bringing the player-driven event to a triumphant close—or so the player behind Lufas' avatar thought until a strange message from the goddess of Exgate summoned him into the game world.\n\nThe player then suddenly awakens in the body of Lufas two hundred years after her defeat, finding Exgate on the brink of extinction at the hands of the Devil King. Now, he must travel the world as Lufas to find her most loyal subjects, the Twelve Heavenly Stars, and discover the reason behind his summoning.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
