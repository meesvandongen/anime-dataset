  "synopsis": "Student council president Yuuzou Kokusai would be a rather ordinary high school student, except for a strange magnetism that attracts men who are unable to keep their hands to themselves. When Kokusai suddenly needs to find a new vice president, he selects his reliable friend, Yasuhiro Chiga. After witnessing Kokusai being groped on a train, Chiga takes it upon himself to become his bodyguard. However, with the increased proximity between the two, Chiga finds that he is not immune to Kokusai's charms either.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
