  "synopsis": "After being summoned to another world, ordinary salaryman Tsuyoshi Mukouda has made a name for himself with his fabulous cooking. During his journey throughout different lands, he has even befriended the mythical wolf Fel and a slime named Sui. While enjoying a meal one day, the trio is interrupted by a tiny but rare pixie dragon who also wants a bite of their food. Like Fel and Sui, the dragon immediately falls in love with Mukouda's cooking and decides to become the man's familiar, receiving the name Dora-chan.\n\nHowever, cooking is not Mukouda's only forte. His familiars' incredible strength constantly attracts the attention of guilds who ask for their help on different quests. In exchange, the guilds are able to process the game Mukouda and his familiars hunt, enabling their growing party to sample various kinds of monster meat. Continuing to travel around the world with his familiars, Mukouda always comes up with new mouth-watering recipes that will leave everyone hoping for a second serving.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
