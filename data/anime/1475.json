  "synopsis": "After the US military ousts a sadistic Central-American tyrant, a spirit of merciless vengeance is born. And when the Bay City Hotel unveils its new supercomputer, the deposed ruler and his loyal daughter devise a plan. With her hacking skills, the very same computer that delivers room service can now deliver a nuclear payload right to Washington's front door. But their nuclear vengeance has one unforeseen problem—City Hunter. And now, the only question remaining is who's finger is faster? The girl on the button or the man on the trigger? \n\n(Source: Sunrise, edited)",
