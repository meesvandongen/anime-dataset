  "synopsis": "Even though he is a young child, Gil-son is the only one able to guide his older sister Gam-i as the two orphans wander in search of a home. When a kind monk offers to shelter them, they are glad for their stroke of good luck, but the rambunctious Gil-son constantly causes trouble for the monastery. Despite seemingly having little respect for proper decorum, the boy just might be closer to achieving enlightenment than anyone could have predicted.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
