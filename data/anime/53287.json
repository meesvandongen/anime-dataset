  "synopsis": "As the Love Live! Competition draws to a close, Kanon Shibuya takes an offer to study abroad and bids farewell to her friends and fellow members of the school idol group Liella!. Although they will live on opposite sides of the world, both Kanon and the group remain motivated to continue their idol activities.\n\nUnbeknownst to Kanon, however, her plans are cut short by Wien Margarete's parents, who request that Kanon remain in Japan for another year so that their daughter can learn from her. While Kanon finds herself in awkward limbo, Wien cannot bring herself to join her once fierce rival Liella! and decides to start a group of her own.\n\nNot wanting Wien's determination to go to waste, Kanon joins the new group, recruiting her former group member's sister Tomari Onitsuka in the process. As the newfound unit strives to wash off Wien's controversial past, the new Liella! is also wrestling with the struggles of losing their irreplaceable center.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
