  "synopsis": "The KITSAT-1 satellite has long since ceased performing its job of photographing the Korean Peninsula. Much to its surprise, a strange force gives the device a body resembling a young girl after it falls out of orbit and lands on Earth. Even more perplexing is that KITSAT-1 soon meets Ko Kyung-chun, a young man with a gift for music who is trapped in the body of a milk cow. Kyung-chun has tragically been affected by a curse that turns those with broken hearts into animals.\n\nTaking the name Il-ho, the satellite strives to protect Kyung-chun from forces hunting those trapped in animal bodies, along with the wizard Merlin, who has been transformed into a roll of toilet paper. As Il-ho and Kyung-chun navigate their strange new lives, growing emotions make their bond inseparable.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
