  "synopsis": "Forming a party with one's mother in an online game seems not only unlikely but also uncomfortable to most teenage gamers. \n\nUnfortunately, Masato Oosuki finds himself in that exact scenario. After completing a seemingly meaningless survey, he is thrown into the world of a fantasy MMORPG—and his mother Mamako actually tagged along with him! On top of all of that, Mamako turns out to be an overpowered swordswoman, possessing the power of two-hit multi-target attacks! After minor tension between the two, they search for party members, meeting the merchant Porta and the sage Wise, starting their journey to clear the game.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
