Following their reunion at the airport, Kanna—accompanied by Kobayashi, Tooru, and other friends—takes Chloe around the attractions of Japan, starting with Akihabara. Expertly guided by Tooru, the group enjoys exploring the city before returning home to meet with Saikawa and continue their adventures.\n\nAs Chloe's final day in Japan draws near, Kobayashi helps set up a farewell party so everyone can enjoy one last event together before Chloe returns to the United States.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
