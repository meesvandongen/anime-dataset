  "synopsis": "Keiichi Oyamada has a mysterious power that always makes him seem like a lucky pervert, as one way or another, he ends up having sexual intercourse with any female he meets. Due to this, he has never had a stable job as he continually gets fired from any place unfortunate enough to employ him. \n\nOne job opportunity arises when his best friend calls him to work at a manga cafe, which Keiichi reluctantly accepts. However, as soon as he starts his new job, he meets Rei Suzukawa, a fellow employee, and Kururu Hiiragi, his childhood friend. Both of them are very beautiful, and Keiichi fears that even they might not be spared by his lucky perverted powers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
