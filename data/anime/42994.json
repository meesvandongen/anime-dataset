  "synopsis": "Ever since she was summoned from Hell by the witch Yurine Hanazono, Jashin-chan—a half-human, half-snake demon—has been searching for any way to go back. One of her options is to kill the one who summoned her, which is much easier said than done. Jashin-chan often finds herself getting violently beaten by Yurine after not only any failed murder attempt, but also when she is just causing mischief, destroying any hope of going back home to Hell.\n\nThe demon is also terrible with money and tends to gamble all of it away at pachinko. In one of these gambling sessions, she loses the three million yen she received from Hell Financing, putting her into a lifelong debt. To avoid repaying it altogether, Jashin-chan flees to Hokkaido to try and hide for the rest of her days, but her wish of having her debts forgotten may just be a pipe dream when someone comes knocking for the money.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
