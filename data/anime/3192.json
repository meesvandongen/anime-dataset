  "synopsis": "Miyako \"Neko\" Negishi has never fit in. Instead of spending time with the other girls in her class, she hangs out with a playboy named Haruka Saiki. Despite their differences, the two share a unique bond and a magical secret.\n\nAs the school welcomes a new transfer student, Keichiirou Yamagishi, Neko senses that he might be similar to her and Haruka. When the three students meet up one evening, they are suddenly pulled into a portal to another world. There, oppressed people await the return of their mythical warrior queen destined to save them all. Neko, Haruka, and Keichiirou decide to fight together for the people's liberation, and it appears as if this fantastical realm had been waiting for Neko all along.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
