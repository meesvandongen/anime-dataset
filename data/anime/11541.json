  "synopsis": "Emiri Katou and Kaori Fukuhara, the voice actresses best known for playing the Hiiragi twins in Lucky Star, will headline Ad Lib Anime Kenkyūsho (Ad Lib Anime Laboratory), an experimental anime series which will premiere on the satellite channel BS Fuji on October 15.\n\nKatou (as \"Chief Researcher No. 001\"), Fukuhara (\"Chief Researcher No. 002\"), and a guest star \"researcher\" will ad lib each weekly episode's script entirely from scratch. Animators will then take the ad-libbed dialogue and create footage based on them — instead of the castmembers voice-acting to existing scripts and footage, as most anime are made.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
