  "synopsis": "In 1968, a Phantom Moon is observed over the world. At the same time, a young boy named Nakajo Taku must accompany his father to an important business call. Once there, Taku and his family meet up with Louis Boudre and David Flight, two humans with supernatural abilities. Taku is able to learn telekinesis from these two men. Soon after, they are all seized against their will by a strange man, and transported 500 million years in the past to the moon. There, Taku meets Price Noman, and it's up to them and the Noman Rangers to put a stop to the intergalactic war between humans and aliens.\n\nThe pilot was partially in color, and ran for exactly 12 minutes and 20 seconds. It is unknown why the pilot was never serialized, but one could speculate that it was because of financial reasons. Another pilot made around the same time, Zero Man, was cancelled early into production due to Mushi Pro struggling to fund the show. Seeing as how the Noman pilot was nearly three times as long as the Zero Man pilot, it's easy to see how Mushi Pro would struggle financially with such a production.\n\n(Source: Lost Media Wiki)",
