  "synopsis": "Idol group F/ACE has recently risen in popularity all thanks to Tamon Fukuhara—its handsome, wild, and talented leader. Seventeen-year-old Utage Kinoshita is one of the vocal fans who greatly admires F/ACE. As her life revolves around worshiping Tamon, Utage works at a housecleaning company to earn money and continue supporting him.\n\nWhen her coworker gets sick, Utage is assigned to a new client with the same name as Tamon. She believes it is merely a coincidence—until she comes face to face with the real celebrity! Her surprise only grows when she discovers that, unlike the extroverted superstar known to the public, Tamon is actually a gloomy guy with no friends or self-confidence.\n\nGiven that Utage's adoration for Tamon knows no bounds, she vows to keep his secret and stay by his side—but dealing with Tamon's contrasting behaviors in and out of work might be the toughest job out there.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
