The short is titled Natsu no Niwa (Summer Garden) and is the first independent anime produced by Arai's newly founded studio FILMONY.\n\nThe three-minute video features the song \"HEY HEY HO\" by ENJOY MUSIC CLUB featuring singer and songwriter Sachie Hiraga. The story takes place in a city turned upside-down after a girl named Mea discovers a stuffed animal with a strange power.\n\nThe GO!ME project sponsors \"youth who are going their own way.\" The project's first video outlined some of its collaborations with dancers, musicians, tech innovators, and animators.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
