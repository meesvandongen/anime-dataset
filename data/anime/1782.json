The island has been deserted of human life and the ruins of a once promising city continue to decay. Each of the group members have a reason to visit the island, including returning to their former homes or embarking on a scavenger hunt. During their visit, strange events start to take place and past memories and sexual emotions began to surface among the group. The tour takes a turn for the worst when several of tourists are found murdered, showing that someone remains on the desolated island.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
