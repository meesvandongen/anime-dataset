  "synopsis": "Mayoiga was once a mystical site in the mountains where travelers were rewarded extremely well. Today, this magical place is located inside a maid cafe. For Natsuki, one of the employed maids, it was not riches or fame that she found here—but the love and pleasure from a young student named Isami.\n\nOne day, after receiving an affectionate message, Isami decides to visit Natsuki. However, Natsuki's coworker Akiha takes a quick liking to Isami and unexpectedly becomes Natsuki's rival for his attention.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
