  "synopsis": "Mysterious incidents involving giant robots kidnapping high-level athletes have started occurring all over the world. Dr. Kim suspects his former colleague, the often-ridiculed Dr. Kaff, is the mastermind behind these events. Though he has no proof, he knows that only Dr. Kaff possesses the scientific knowledge and disdain for society required to pull off such a plan. Thankfully, his own crowning achievement, Robot Taekwon V, is ready to protect humanity. Piloted by his son, taekwondo champion Kim Hoon, Robot Taekwon V is the only force capable of stopping Dr. Kaff's evil plans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
