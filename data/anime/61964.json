One day after a crack forms on her smartphone, her real-life self is replaced by her digital counterpart, “SHIORI,” who emerges from the smartphone world. Trapped in the smartphone world instead, Shiori is powerless and forced to watch as her counterfeit self energetically rises to stardom as a pop icon and influencer. With the help of Komori, a mysterious rabbit-man she meets in this digital wonderland, Shiori must navigate an eerie and surreal cyber labyrinth to get back to her reality.\n\n(Source: GAGA)",
