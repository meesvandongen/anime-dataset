Additionally, fighting is only done by \"fighting pairs\" or couples, where one is known as the Sacrifice and the other as the Fighter. The first receives the damage while the latter attacks.\n\nRitsuka Aoyagi is a 12-year-old boy, who for some unknown reason suffers from amnesia. His brother got killed recently, and as if his life has not been hard enough lately, on his first day at the new school he gets approached by a stranger called Agatsuma Soubi, who claims to have known his late brother.

All the while, it seems that Ritsuka and Agatsuma are becoming closer than they intended to beâ€¦",
