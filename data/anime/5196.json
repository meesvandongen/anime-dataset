  "synopsis": "The path to becoming a Prima Undine—a guide who can lead tours on her gondola—-is long and arduous, but that does not mean there is no time to enjoy the pleasures Neo-Venezia has to offer! For Akari Mizunashi and her Undine companions, Aika S. Granzchesta and Alice Carroll, participating in various fun activities provides much-needed downtime from their intense Prima Undine training. Joined by friends whom they have met throughout their journey, the girls make unforgettable memories that shine brighter for being in the city of miracles.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
