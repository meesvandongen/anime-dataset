  "synopsis": "After passing away, a Japanese office worker finds himself reincarnated in another world as Ars, the newborn son of the noble Louvent family. The Summerforth Empire, where the Louvents rule over a small territory of a few thousand people, is a medieval-like land plagued by social inequality and political instability. As Ars grows older and learns more and more about his new environment, he becomes convinced that war will soon erupt.\n\nFortunately, though Ars was not blessed with unrivaled strength or extraordinary magical aptitude, he does possess Appraisal: a seemingly unique skill that allows him to instantly grasp someone's current abilities and latent talents merely by looking at them. In an effort to prepare his domain for the imminent strife, Ars resolves to enlist the most exceptional people he can find, paying no attention to superficial qualities like race or social status.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
