Meanwhile, he continues to assist his mentor Arataka Reigen and the office's new recruit, Katsuya Serizawa, in solving paranormal cases of their clients. While continuing his duties, Mob also works on gaining more independence in his esper and human lives, as well as trying to integrate better with the people around him.\n\nHowever, new supernatural and ordinary challenges test Mob’s emotional stability and force him to confront the realities around him.
