  "synopsis": "When Yun Arikawa and his partner, Haberu Katou, investigate a house rumored to be haunted, the last thing they expect is to stumble into a mystery that will soon envelop the entire planet. While measuring strange radio signals, they receive a call from Mei Kamino, a graduate student investigating the same signal and using the equipment their company previously installed.\n\nAfter an odd night, Yun returns to work at Ootaki Factory, a tech company that actually exists to produce Jet Jaguar—a robot that conspiracy theorist Gorou Ootaki has dreamed of creating. However, when flying dinosaur-like creatures known as Rodan are attracted to the strange radio signals, Jet Jaguar seems to be the only force capable of fighting them. As Yun and Mei investigate the Rodans' sudden appearance, more dangerous monsters begin to surface from the ocean—along with enigmatic red dust.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
