  "synopsis": "Chu Feng, a rising star in Qingzhou, accompanied Qinglong Sect Master Li Changqing to the Hundred Sects Conference, Qingzhou's premier event, where he forged a feud with the powerful and domineering Lingyun Sect Master Yan Yangtian. Little did he know, the Hundred Sects Conference, ostensibly a sect competition, was actually a shocking conspiracy by Yan Yangtian. As his strength grew, Chu Feng mastered the power of golden and blue divine thunder. However, this power accidentally disturbed the long-dormant Ice and Fire Pearls, forcing his friends Su Rou and Su Mei to be possessed by the pearls while trying to save Chu Feng, putting their lives in imminent danger. \n\nDetermined to save his friends, Chu Feng embarked on a treasure hunt in Ten Thousand Demons Mountain, vowing to rescue the Purple-Robed World Spiritist, the Demon Monkey King, and save the two Su brothers. Along the way, Chu Feng met Jiang Wushang, a young man from the imperial dynasty, and reunited with Zi Ling, a girl gifted with a divine body and a mysterious past. He finally reunited with his renowned senior from the same sect, Zhang Tianyi, founder of the Winged Alliance. Ultimately, thanks to the loyalty of Dandan, Ziling, Jiang Wushang, Zhang Tianyi, and others, and his own growing strength, Chu Feng retrieves the Shura Ghost Axe, rescues the Demon Monkey King, successfully rescues the two Su brothers, and uncovers the conspiracy of Lingyun Sect Master Yan Yangtian. Ultimately, he turns the tide and resolves the crisis in Kyushu. To unravel the mystery of his own identity, he embarks on a journey to the vast Eastern Sea...\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",
