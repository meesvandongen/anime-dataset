  "synopsis": "After joining her new school, the enthusiastic 15-year-old Tsubasa Sonokawa believes she immediately experienced a fated encounter. While in trouble, she was helped by her upperclassman and fell in love with him. However, due to her habit of overdoing things, Tsubasa's feelings are not reciprocated.\n\nAs Tsubasa goes through the heartbreak, her childhood friend asks her to be the temporary manager of the school's basketball team. Right on her first day, the girl is almost hit by a ball, but she is saved by Aki Hidaka, a member of the team. Despite her overzealous ways, Tsubasa finds her life getting more vibrant by the day as a friendship blossoms between the two.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
