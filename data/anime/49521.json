  "synopsis": "Beginning her academic journey as a first grader, Shiori comes face to face with the aspect of school she has heard alarming rumors about—homework! However, her worries quickly turn into excitement as the Asahigaoka girls agree to work together to complete their assignments at Komari and Natsumi Koshigaya's house. Their plan appears to be successful until an all-too-familiar feeling of procrastination creates a rowdy distraction for Natsumi.\n\nOn another day, Natsumi asks her teacher Kazuho Miyauchi if she can form and lead a new badminton school club. While the lack of funding and equipment proves to be a major setback, it does not stop Natsumi and the other girls from asking the candy store owner Kaede Kagayama for some help. During their spontaneous badminton practice, a minor accident leads Kaede to reminisce about a memorable day when she babysat Renge Miyauchi.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
