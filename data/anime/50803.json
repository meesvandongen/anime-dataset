  "synopsis": "Fumiya Tomozaki is now cruising through the game of life—all thanks to the guidance of Aoi Hinami, his popular classmate and rival in the online game Attack Families, widely known as \"Tackfam.\" As the summer holiday draws to a close and a new term commences, Tomozaki reunites with Aoi, who reminds him of his ultimate goals: to become well-liked among his peers and find himself a girlfriend.\n\nHowever, Tomozaki puts his ambitions on hold when his innocent friend, Hanabi Natsubayashi, starts being bullied. To make matters worse, Aoi is characteristically out of touch with the situation. But Tomozaki is not alone in resolving this issue—he now has a group of loyal friends who are all determined to help Hanabi and ensure they enjoy their youths together to the fullest.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
