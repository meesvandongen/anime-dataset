  "synopsis": "The recruitment of new students in various clubs of CMFU Academy is in full swing. Freshman Minnie has joined the CMFU Fencing Club because of her fascination with \"Three Musketeers\". The swordsman contest is coming soon, and the president Chu Zhuoran intends to conduct an internal trial in the fencing club to select contestants for the swordsman contest. Minnie was excluded because of her zero foundation, but she didn't get discouraged and approached the president Chu Zhuoran to ask for fair participation in the selection. In desperation, Chu Zhuoran decided to give Minnie a week to personally train her. The Fencing Club of the Yunzong Academy in the same city also came here, not only to find out the strength of the newly recruited female swordsmen of CMFU, but Lian Kai, the president of the Fencing Club of the Yunzong Academy, had a holiday with A Qiao, a member of the CMFU Fencing Club. This series shows how the CMFU Academy Fencing Club prepares for the swordsman competition and Minnie's growth as a zero-base fencer, conveys the charm of campus sports, encourages more audiences to learn about fencing and love the sport of fencing.\n\n(Source: Tencent video)",
