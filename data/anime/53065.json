  "synopsis": "After Marin Kitagawa introduced Wakana Gojou to the world of cosplay, he has been creating her outfits with ease. Even so, he still has a lot to learn, and every new lesson seems to strengthen his love for sewing and for the hina dolls his grandfather taught him to make.\n\nMeanwhile, Kitagawa finds it harder and harder to hide her feelings for Gojou. Friends and strangers alike constantly mistake them for a couple, much to Gojou's embarrassment. After all, in his eyes, their worlds are far too different for anyone to think they could be romantically linked. However, as Gojou spends more time with Kitagawa and realizes that his passions are not ridiculed by other people, a relationship between the two no longer seems so far-fetched.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
