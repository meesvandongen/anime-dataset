  "synopsis": "Cain Asbell was an unremarkable guy until he rescued Princess Charlotte. He goes from pauper to Lord, but there's a catch. Cain has to make his land the most prosperous in the country within 5 years. If he fails, he'll lose everything. But if he succeeds, Cain will gain the Princess Charlotte's hand in marriage.\n\nDuring his quest for success, he faces slavers and bandits. But being a Lord isn't all bad -- he has the right to choose any woman he wants to go to bed with him.",
