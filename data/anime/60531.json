  "synopsis": "Azusa Kannawa, ace of the publicity department, is known for her unmatched reliability. Her coworkers, on the other hand, find her no-nonsense demeanor intimidating. Yet, unbeknownst to them, a socially awkward woman hides underneath the facade, simply struggling with casual communication and masking it with a strong attitude. However, her mask begins to crack when a promising rookie, Yuu Kamegawa, joins the team and Azusa gets assigned as his mentor.\n\nDetermined to guide Kamegawa just like how her senior once trained her, Kannawa puts utmost effort into showing him the ropes. But as they grow closer, she slowly lowers her guard, gradually revealing that the seemingly rigid department ace might actually be far kinder than anyone initially thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
