  "synopsis": "The year is 1948, three years since the atomic bomb destroyed Hiroshima and much of the Nakaoka family. Gen Nakaoka, his mother, and his adopted brother, Ryuuta, struggle to survive in the ruins of their once flourishing city. And yet, after befriending a group of homeless orphans, Gen realizes that in many ways, he is lucky. As the effects of radiation poisoning and the insensitive actions made by foreign troops continue to shape Hiroshima, Gen and Ryuuta must find strength within themselves if they ever hope to prosper.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
