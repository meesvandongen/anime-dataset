  "synopsis": "Yi Wu was thrust onto the World Cup stage because of a single online \"like.\" He then inexplicably appeared in a closed arena, where a countdown was implanted in everyone. To gain time to survive, they had to engage in a new, multi-strategy competition, escape perilous environments, and navigate secret chambers. This unique environment forced them to both cooperate and compete, and behind it all, a legend of a \"spiritual kingdom\" seemed to be circulating.\n\n(Source: iQIYI, translated)",
