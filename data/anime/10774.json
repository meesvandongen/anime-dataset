  "synopsis": "Together with the hero of this series, Brian Thompson an ex-reporter, we get to relive the great games of the Football World Cup.\n\nThe story begins with the first selection which took place in Uruguay 1930 until 1994 when it was held in the United States. We also get a depiction of Thompson's life from his youth until now. \n\nWe also see the game brilliantly reborn through spectacular players like Franz Beckenbauer, Müller Gard, Eusebio and the greatest of them all, Pelé.\n\n(Source: A somewhat rough translation of a summary of the series from the French site \"Planéte Jeunesse\")",
