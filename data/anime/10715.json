  "synopsis": "After a series of shocking revelations, Shun Kazami—more commonly known as the WTOC cyborg Epsilon—ends up in the care of Quon Mitsuchi and the rest of the Fantasium Gardens Attractors. While most of the Attractors are hostile toward the man who, until recently, had been violently hunting them, Quon insists that they must protect Shun. Furthermore, the advanced computers embedded in Shun's body mean that regardless of his feelings on the matter, it will not be long before Custos knows exactly where he is.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
