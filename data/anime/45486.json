  "synopsis": "Ever since moving to an in-game world after countless hours of VRMMO grinding, Yuna now calls Crimonia—the city where she started—home. While maintaining her reputation as a renowned adventurer, she continues to manage her businesses; but most importantly, Yuna spends time with the people she has grown to love. Nevertheless, this world has a lot more to offer the carefree adventurer. It is up to Yuna to discover these wonders, and perhaps help more people in need as she encounters their various plights.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
