  "synopsis": "Driven by an unwavering passion for becoming an idol, Yu Azuma, a young, ambitious first-year student at Joshu East High School, embarks on a journey to form an idol group. To make her dream a reality, she recruits one girl from each of her region’s four high schools, located to the north, east, south and west, and soon finds her fellow group members.\n\nJoining Yu is Ranko Kashima, a sophisticated second-year student at Holy Teneritas Southern Girls’ Academy, with a distinctive curly hairstyle and admiration for Madame Butterfly; Kurumi Taiga, a student at West Tech Vocational High School, who wears cute, oversized jackets with long sleeves and dreams of winning the championship at a robotics competition; and, Mika Kamei, a student who also hails from Joshu North High School, known for being a kind-hearted girl and for her dedication to volunteering.\n\nWith the help of Shinji Kudo, Yu's \"collaborator\" and confidante, these four young girls set off on the road to stardom. But the journey hides unexpected trials, rigorous demands, setbacks and pressures, threatening to undo all that Yu has worked so hard for.\n\n(Source: AMC, edited)",
