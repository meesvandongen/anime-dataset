  "synopsis": "In the near future, humans and animals live in harmony. The result is the emergence of half-humans who live like normal people, but with their own characteristics.\n\nEpisode 1: The decent and clean goat Maya periodically shaves her fur on the lower part of her body, which she is very embarrassed about, because many people would dislike it. One day, right while shaving, her owner Christophe catches her. The girl has already managed to get upset, but in vain. What is natural is wonderful. And the young lord was eager to help her.\n\nEpisode 2: Little Meguru unexpectedly met a big dog Mokka in an alley and got scared and wet himself. The dog calmed the boy down and invited him over to dry his clothes and take a shower. But as soon as the husky took off her clothes to help him in the bath, the boy could no longer think about anything but her.",
