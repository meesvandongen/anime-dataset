  "synopsis": "On the 20th floor of the Tower, the \"Regulars\" who have been permitted to enter have to undertake arduous and extremely expensive tests to rank up. Most abandon hope and choose to stay where they are—but not Ja Wangnan.\n\nWangnan is determined to reach the top and become the king of the Tower. However, he is weak and has repeatedly failed the exam, with debt collectors tailing him. In desperation, he attempts the exam one more time, only to encounter a mysterious and powerful individual: Jyu Viole Grace, a member of the crime syndicate FUG.\n\nCursing his rotten luck, Wangnan has no choice but to form alliances with strong people, including Viole—who still refuses to be part of any team. Amid a dire situation, Wangnan must find a way to change Viole's mind to finally advance past the 20th floor, or he will never get a chance to build his legacy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
