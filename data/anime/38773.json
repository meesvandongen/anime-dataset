  "synopsis": "Short animations by Densuke28 simulating video game bugs. The original short was a personal project and was released on his Vimeo page. The following year, a new version of the work was showcased at a museum exhibition on seven different screens, accompanied with a 3D printed model of the character in the short. A forty-nine second clip titled \"BUGGY MAP -Exhibition Ver.-\" was uploaded to Densuke28's official Vimeo which combines the animations on the multiple screens into one video.",
