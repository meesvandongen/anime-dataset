  "synopsis": "Honda is a skeleton, but more importantly, they are a bookseller. And they will tell you from firsthand experience that the job of a bookstore employee is more challenging than it may seem to the average customer.\n\nAlongside their equally eccentric coworkers, Honda constantly deals with the stressful requirements of the bookselling industry. From the drama of receiving new titles without their bonus material to the struggle of providing quality service to customers who speak a different language, the work of a skeleton bookseller never ends.\n\nNevertheless, despite the hardships they face, Honda thoroughly enjoys their job and strives to bring the best book selections and service to their customers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
