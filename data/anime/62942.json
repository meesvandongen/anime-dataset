  "synopsis": "Two inquisitive kids, Tamo and Haru, might be the last people on Earth. They explore the silent, overgrown ruins of what was once rural Japan, documenting their discoveries in a notebook. When they come across a disused commuter train, and find out that it's operational, who knows where it will take them? A disconcertingly cheerful and childish interpretation of the end of the world.\n\n(Source: fantasiafestival.com)",
