  "synopsis": "Gun Koma is an ordinary high schooler with an intense love of motorcycles and a need for speed. When one of his classmates invites him to be part of a four-hour race that could help him reach the big leagues, Gun seizes the opportunity. The only catch is that he will have to team up with his longtime street racing rival Hideyoshi Hijiri. The opportunity to race on a formal circuit is tempting, but he must steel himself and set aside his differences with Hideyoshi to claim the gold.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
