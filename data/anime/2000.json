  "synopsis": "College student Haruko Mihashi volunteers as a nurse providing at-home care for the elderly. However, when one of her patients, Kijuro Takazawa, is suddenly taken away to be the first person placed in a Z-001 bed, she is concerned. While the bed's technology is impressive, automatically attending to all of a patient's needs, it lacks the compassion that human caregivers provide.\n\nHaruka's worries become even more serious when she receives a computerized message begging her for help. Deciding that something must be done, she and her friends sneak into Takazawa's room and discover that the Z-001's computer is capable of much more than they imagined.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
