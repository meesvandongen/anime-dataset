Fortunately, one man—the legendary exorcist—stopped the devastation. Using his divine powers, he sealed the monster away and the world has enjoyed peace ever since. \n\nMizuki Henmi is an adolescent girl who is acquainted with Shu Suzuri, a dull young man who runs an old Japanese bookstore. During a routine visit to his store, Mizuki learns of a mysterious and valuable book that Shu is planning to sell.

However, ominous winds begin blowing. While Shu is infatuated with his arachnid friend, Mizuki becomes wary of its every move…\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
