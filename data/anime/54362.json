  "synopsis": "Bestowed with magic from God, witches worked to guide humanity toward progress, garnering adoration and fear alike from humans. However, times have since changed. With the advancement of scientific knowledge, humans now stand on an equal footing with witches. Determined to weave their own destinies and establish supremacy over the world, the mighty Redia Empire has ordered the extermination of all witches, which may bring the era of magic to an end.\n\nFleeing from the decree, the famed witch Chloe and her apprentice, Adonis, seek refuge. Hot on their heels, the Empire captures the duo and mercilessly executes Chloe. Agonized by the brutal murder of his master and the callousness of humans, Adonis vows to avenge Chloe by annihilating humanity with the very magic they intend to destroy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
