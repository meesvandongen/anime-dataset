  "synopsis": "In the year 20XX, space development had progressed beyond the present day, and humanity had expanded its living spaces across many planets. On the far edge of the galaxy lies the Countryside Planet, home to Moyori Obayashi, a first-year high school student who enjoys collecting scraps and discarded things, and her friend Kayo Daijamori, a girl who dreams of magic and loves to imagine other worlds. This is the story of a mysterious summer day they share. Set in a society increasingly focused on standardizing and controlling people, the story asks how the overlooked, undefined spaces—those pushed out of view—may hold something essential for preserving our humanity and the freedom to be ourselves.\n\n(Source: Indie-AniFest)",
