  "synopsis": "A love poem from the 1935 German film soundtrack has become a synonym for the funeral procession \"Sisomi\" in Taiwan, creating an interesting and absurd contrast between the two. The dance movements are interwoven with the stories of dead animals and death that belong to the city, telling their own life stories.\n\n(Source: Goldenhorse, translated)",
