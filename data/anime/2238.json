  "synopsis": "Touma Kusaka stands out from the rest of the Choshu Clan, as he does not share their anti-foreigner sentiment. After reuniting with Keiichirou Akizuki, a vassal of the Tokugawa family who once helped him escape from government authorities, the pair begin studying English in secret.\n\nAs they continue to meet behind their feuding families' backs, romance between the two begins to bloom. But with war looming on the horizon between their respective clans, Kusaka and Akizuki's hope for a world where they can be together may never come to fruition if their obligations and bloodlines get in the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
