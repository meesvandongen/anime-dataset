  "synopsis": "Tsubasa Arihara loves baseball so much, she actually started her high school's baseball club! But passion alone won't keep a club alive, so it's up to her to recruit as many all-star players as she can. Some potential recruits have never played before while others have returned to the game thanks to Tsubasa's love for the sport, and together they'll form a team united in love for the game as much as their growing friendship. But whether they win or lose, one thing is for sure: every game they play together is sure to be a home run!\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",
