  "synopsis": "Conspiring forces frame Jolyne Kuujou for a reckless crime, landing her in the infamous Green Dolphin Street Jail. Much like her father Joutarou, Jolyne is brash, brave, and just; she rails against her unfair sentence and quickly discovers the sinister circumstances that led to her incarceration.\n\nA gift from her absent father grants Jolyne the power of Stone Free, a supernatural ability known as a Stand that allows her to unravel her body into string. Jolyne uses Stone Free to battle her way through the prison, recruiting new allies—Ermes Costello and Foo Fighters—to assist in her investigation. Together, the fearless women fight to uncover the menace behind Whitesnake, an enemy Stand responsible for the increasingly dangerous prisoners who are after Jolyne's life.\n\nThrough Jolyne, the Joestar lineage confronts the legacy of its one true enemy. Jolyne and her friends race to stop a disastrous plot and put an end to a culminating evil.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
