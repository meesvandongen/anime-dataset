  "synopsis": "Two years have passed since the EL-Divers incident, and the popularity of the game Gunpla Battle Nexus Online (GBN) has continued to skyrocket. With the addition of exciting new features such as missions and story events, the GBN experience is more immersive than ever before. Amidst the player base, a user known as Hiroto Kuga has been gaining notoriety for his top-notch skills.\n\nThrough a series of coincidences, Hiroto meets three other players: the boastful Kazami Torimachi, the mysterious May, and the timid Parviz. Forming the \"BUILD DiVERS,\" the unlikely group sets on a story mission rumored to carry bountiful in-game rewards. Together, the BUILD DiVERS must confront their own weaknesses as they join arms in a journey that may very well transcend the existence of GBN itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
