  "synopsis": "A metaphorical poetry song about the real-life wish of a 15-year-old girl with a terminal illness. She was supposed to have died at the age of 10 but kept fighting to stay alive. The band Indigo Blue who made this song in her honor never had a chance to meet her directly while she was alive but wanted to send her mighty message across Japan that you can be happy if you keep smiling forever.
