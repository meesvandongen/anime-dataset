  "synopsis": "After 26-year-old Kentarou Momose develops health problems due to his boss' abuse, he quits his job and joins a different company. Now, he hopes to start anew under the care of his mentor and direct supervisor, 34-year-old Yuusei Shirosaki.\n\nShirosaki is a capable boss admired by his coworkers, which makes Momose fear letting him down and reliving the past traumas. However, Momose can rest easy, as Shirosaki is always delighted to help—even if he looks absolutely ridiculous doing it. Although it may take some adjusting, Momose realizes that there is no need for caution around his new, endearingly eccentric boss after all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
