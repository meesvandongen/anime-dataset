  "synopsis": "The extremely talented siblings Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba shine bright in their own right as they start their second year at First High School, the premier institute for magicians. Seeing as the pair are inseparable, it seems unimaginable that their loving bond did not exist just four years ago. Back then, the middle schooler Miyuki was uncomfortable around her older brother. She and her family thought of Tatsuya as nothing more than a lowly servant to perform guardian duties for Miyuki; a mere tool lacking emotions and his own will. However, their relationship was fated to change forever once their innocuous family trip to Okinawa transformed into a life-threatening incident.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
