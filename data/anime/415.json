  "synopsis": "From squabbles about groceries against the ambient noise of the TV to their daily shenanigans, the Yamada family invites only a few unusual gazes—similar to any typical household. But despite their prickly exteriors, each of them genuinely cares for one another, making sure to smile and laugh through their otherwise dull and mundane lives. Tonari no Yamada-kun is an intimate and fun look into the lives of a typical Japanese family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
