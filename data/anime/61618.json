  "synopsis": "In a conspiracy, the supreme leader of the martial arts world, Dao Zong, was killed, and the leaders of various gangs were either killed or imprisoned, leaving the martial arts world in chaos. In order to rebuild the order of the martial arts world, Yan Jiyu, the leader of Changfeng Pavilion, sent messengers to various sects, intending to establish a new \"righteous\" martial arts world headed by him. However, at this time, the fledgling Yang Ren was entrusted to deliver a letter left by Dao Zong. Along the way, he was surrounded by powerful enemies and was extremely dangerous, but he relied on his passion and chivalry to constantly break through himself and defeat his opponents. While his martial arts skills improved rapidly, he also met a group of chivalrous and righteous people. What should the martial arts world look like? Yang Ren couldn't answer, but he knew it was definitely not what Yan Jiyu said. Yang Ren put up a big banner: \"Chengfeng Gang\", and quickly gathered together.\n\n(Source: Iqiyi, translated)",
