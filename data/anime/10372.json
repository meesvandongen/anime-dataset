  "synopsis": "When Kyouhei moves to Tokyo, he thinks he's left his old life behind. But when he discovers a bloody corpse, he also discovers that the past isn't easily left behind, especially when the past is as unusual as Kyouhei's. You see, back in his home town, Kyouhei was a \"seki,\" an individual able to control \"kakashi,\" ancient wooden \"gods\" capable of incredible feats, with his mind. Now there's a kakashi loose in Tokyo, and it just may be up to Kyouhei to stop it AND its seki in Kamisama Dolls!\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks, edited)",
