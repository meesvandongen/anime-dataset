  "synopsis": "Underneath the bright city lights lies a bloodied arena bursting with frantic screams and roars. Strong men engage in boxing matches for money, while their audience desperately hopes that their chosen participants will bring them fortune. For the young rising star Mignon, there is only one place that is an escape from the chaos of the ring and his tough life. Mysterious underground doctor Oh Young-One offers his services to injured fighters, and the wide-eyed Mignon finds solace in his quiet infirmary.\n\nYoung-One is gentle and caring, always tending to Mignon's wounds that mainly come from the cruel world beyond the boxing ring. However, the doctor hides a taboo secret about himself. In a rare moment of carelessness, he exposes it to Mignon, putting his life in immediate danger. Even though Young-One warns Mignon to keep his distance in order to protect him, Mignon remains stubborn and refuses to abandon the one person who makes him feel as though he truly matters.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
