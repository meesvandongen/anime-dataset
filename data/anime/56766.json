  "synopsis": "Two thousand years ago, a descendant of the Yinyang Family felt sad for the burning of books and burying of scholars at the order of Qin Shihuang (the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty) and the burning of Epang Palace. In order not to let the scholars die in vain, he began to turn their spirits into brushes for inheritance by future generations. Back to the present day, Luo Zhongxia, an ordinary college student, accidentally gets a brush with Li Bai's spirit, and gains its superpower. But before long, various forces are in a mad scramble for the power, putting Luo Zhongxia in danger in many occasions. To avoid more dangers, Luo Zhongxia tries to find the way to return the brush, but fails every time. On the contrary, Luo Zhongxia becomes inextricably bound up with seven brush spirits.\n\n(Source: Bilibilil)",
