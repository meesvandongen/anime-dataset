  "synopsis": "It begins in Sweetsland: The home of the Dream Animals that has been taken over by cotton candy. The Tabekko Doubutsu find themselves being chased by the cotton candy army of King Gotton, who has banned all other sweets as part of his plan to take over the world. In their rush to escape, Pegasus ends up caught by the sticky soldiers!\n\nThe animals make sparkly eyes at Profession Macaron begging him to help, but their lack of battle strength paired with not knowing how to do anything but be cute to solve all of their problems, the stress of being on the run from King Gotton strains the bonds of their friendship.\n\nLion is discouraged by the seemingly impossible mission to rescue Pegasus, but some advice from Elephant gives him the courage he needs to act! But will it be enough to defeat King Gotton and his cotton candy army and save Pegasus — and the world?!\n\n(Source: Marza Animation Planet, edited)",
