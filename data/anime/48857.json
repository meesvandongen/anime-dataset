  "synopsis": "An established discipline on par with conventional medical approaches, \"vocal medicine\" is the practice of using songs to treat health conditions and injuries. Young people around the world strive to master the art and become \"healers\" to help people through the power of their voices.\n\nAmong the many healers in training is Kana Fujii, a naturally talented singer who was inspired to pursue the profession after a life-changing experience. Along with the driven Reimi Itsushiro and the easygoing Hibiki Morishima, Kana trains at Karasuma Phoniatric Clinic under the stern yet kind mentorship of Ria Karasuma.\n\nAs they endeavor to achieve their dreams, Kana and her friends meet various colorful healers along the way, discovering that there is much more to vocal medicine than just diligent studying!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
