  "synopsis": "Qinglu Academy, once the most glorious magic academy on the Demon Soldier Continent, suffered a calamity after the passing of its former dean. It was attacked by a group of powerful figures led by the former traitor, Mo Tianxiong, resulting in the loss of seven or eight parts of its heritage, as well as the academy's prized \"Qinglu Magic Armor.\" From then on, Qinglu Academy was bullied by other academies and declined further. Just when the academy was in dire straits, a student named Li Qinglu, with a strong connection to the academy, joined it, vowing to lead it back to the ranks of the top magic academies and restore its former glory. The elite students of other academies naturally wouldn't give Li Qinglu such an opportunity, and they all try to bully him, only to be defeated by him. Ultimately, Li Qinglu reclaims the \"Qinglu Magic Armor,\" which had been divided among the academies.\n\n(Source: Tencent, translated)",
