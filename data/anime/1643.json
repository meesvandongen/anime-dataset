  "synopsis": "On the faraway planet of Totsu Asuka, violent crimes using armed robots are on the rise. With the police of Mikado City woefully unequipped to handle this situation, the only hope left to quash the chaos is Sailor Victory: a group of vigilantes with their own armed robots serving justice with speed and style. With public opinion of the police department at an all-time low, the force is willing to do anything to bolster its image against Sailor Victory—even if it has to resort to unscrupulous methods.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
