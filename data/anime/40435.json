  "synopsis": "The cultivation classes in the Cloud Recesses have started, and Wei Wuxian is as mischievous as ever. From getting in trouble for cheating to tempting the ever-so-cold and stoic Lan Wangji into breaking one of the three thousand strict rules of the Gusu Lan Clan—he's done it all. Although almost everything Wei Wuxian does is against Lan Wangji's principles, an unbreakable bond forms between the two. \n\nThis chibi spin-off is a refreshing compilation of the hilarious and adorable moments of Mo Dao Zu Shi that shows not only how impish Wei Wuxian can be, but also the bashful side of the icy Lan Wangji.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
