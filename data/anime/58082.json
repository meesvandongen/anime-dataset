  "synopsis": "Tsukasa Atsumi is a salaryman who leads an ordinary, solitary life. On his way back from work one evening, he is saved from a demon attack by a mysterious woman in a ninja outfit. Introducing herself as Shizuri Ideura, she claims that demons target people like Tsukasa, who have Samurai Blood in their veins, and that her kind have been protecting them from the shadows.\n\nTold by Shizuri that the attacks are going to become more frequent, Tsukasa makes a deal to provide her with housing in exchange for his safety. To his surprise, he quickly finds out that Shizuri is a shut-in who loves to play video games whenever she is not busy with her ninja duties. As the two spend more time together, Tsukasa grows to appreciate Shizuri's company—and his feelings just might be mutual.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
