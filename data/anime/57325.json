  "synopsis": "Meet Tamako, who's found her way into an interview at a ramen shop run solely by cats. When the feline manager asks if she likes cats, Tamako admits that she's actually more of a dog person...only to be hired on the spot! But her job description isn't quite what she expects — rather than serving ramen, she's now a dedicated cat caretaker...?!\n\n(Source: MANGA Plus)",
