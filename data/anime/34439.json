  "synopsis": "Having achieved miraculous victories in a series of battles against the Britannian Army, Lelouch Lamperouge has brought the Black Knights, his paramilitary organization, to a more powerful state than ever before. Nothing seems impossible for him when he utilizes his military strength, intellect, and Geass power of absolute obedience. \n\nHowever, obstacles in the face of the uprising never cease, putting Lelouch in a difficult predicament. Most worryingly, Suzaku Kururugi's combat prowess and the appearance of a mysterious child named V.V. threaten to put an end to Lelouch's great rebellion. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
