Having been pulled into a wormhole by an unfamiliar girl, Jun Jiu inadvertently swaps souls with her and is transmigrated into an unknown cultivation world as the daughter of the Jun family. After deciding to take revenge on those who had wronged the previous owner of her body, Jun Jiu saves a sealed Mo Wuyue without realizing his true identity. With firm determination and knowledge from her previous life, Jun Jiu walks on the path of cultivation along with her mystic cat, while Mo Wuyue supports her from the shadows despite his aloof facade.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
