  "synopsis": "The anthropomorphic animal society stands at a precipice. Following the unmasking of the carnivorous murderer at Cherryton Academy, the school introduces a new segregation policy to protect herbivores, further fueling public disdain for carnivores. Meanwhile, the black market for meat thrives like never before, and the Shishi-gumi, a powerful gang of lions, faces upheaval after losing their leader. A shadowy, violent figure emerges, intending to seize control of the Shishi-gumi with the introduction of an appetizing energy drink for carnivores.\n\nHaving left school, Legoshi, a gentle gray wolf at odds with his predatory instincts, attempts to lead an unassuming life; he only uses his innate strength to protect the weak. However, his involvement with the academy's murder investigation draws the attention of the current Beastar—society's leading authority. For the sake of his controversial relationship with white dwarf rabbit Haru, Legoshi clings to his sense of justice, even when he sinks into the chaos caused by rising tensions between carnivores and herbivores.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
