In anticipation of the event, Eila Ilmatar Juutilainen of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing is determined to take Sanya V. Litvyak on a leisurely walk around the city. However, despite Eila's best intentions, she gets interrupted every time she gets a chance to ask Sanya out, ruining the moment and separating the girls. To make things worse, a Neuroi is approaching the base, threatening both the squadmates and the celebration in Petersburg.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
