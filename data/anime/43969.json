Ensuring that their relationship will stay strong, he spares no effort in showering affection to his now beloved girlfriend.\n\nHowever, one afternoon, another girl named Nagisa Minase suddenly confesses to Naoya following months of preparation. Even though he politely rejects her, Nagisa's irresistible charm and determination continue to attract Naoya. Wanting to fulfill both Saki and Nagisa's desires, Naoya ends up proposing a crazy idea—to date the two of them simultaneously, with both girls fully aware. This unprecedented state of affairs ultimately causes wacky and hilarious situations in whatever they do to keep their unusual relationship going. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
