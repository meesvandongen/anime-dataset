  "synopsis": "Six thousand years later, the once prosperous Sword Stream had declined, relying only on the Sword God Chao Qingqiu to support the current Swordsman Flow to fight the twelve saints of the Three Streams. Li Fuyao had great hatred. To make a living by telling a story in a small town, go to Jianshan, go to the land of the devil, and go to the land of Buddhism. After taking revenge, I realized that there was a huge conspiracy all over the world. Why did the Sword Stream begin to decline six thousand years ago? Why couldn’t the saints and Sword Gods of six thousand years be unable to obtain Immortality? Why did Chao Qingqiu live in the world with suspended animation? What exactly are lanterns in Buddhism? Is the dragon in the Land of Devils a visitor from the outside world? What’s there? All these things unfolded step by step as Li Fuyao continued to grow.\n\n(Source: Animexin)",
