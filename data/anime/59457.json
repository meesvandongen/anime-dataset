  "synopsis": "Mild-mannered Koushi Shirota is left utterly stunned when he witnesses the perfect student council president, Takane Takamine, ever so brazenly strip her panties off in front of the entire class after receiving an uncharacteristic test score of 98%. Even stranger, the imperfect score suddenly becomes a perfect 100% right before his eyes. Wanting to make sure what happened was not just a hallucination, he confronts her about it.\n\nSeemingly unbothered, Takamine reveals to him that she has an ability called Eternal Virgin Road, which allows her to undo any mistake she makes by taking off a piece of underwear, thus keeping up her prodigious facade. With Shirota being the only one aware of the truth, Takamine coerces him into becoming her closet—a carrier of spare panties—so that she can use Eternal Virgin Road as many times as she wants. With his already weak will being constantly put to the test, Shirota's life is flipped upside down as he finds himself too close for comfort with the unpredictable student council president. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
