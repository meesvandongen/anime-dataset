  "synopsis": "Kiyo Nozuki and Sumire Herai are childhood friends who share a common desire to become maikos—apprentice geishas. When they join a maiko house, Kiyo is deemed unfit to be a maiko and ends up employed as a live-in cook. On the other hand, Sumire perfectly fits the maiko image and undergoes training to become one. Although disheartened by her own failure, the ever-optimistic Kiyo cooks for everyone in the house, happy to nourish and encourage them in their endeavors.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
