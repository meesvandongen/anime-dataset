  "synopsis": "Luo Yun, an orphan boy, has a mysterious background. When he became an adult, he was accidentally pulled into the \"East China Sea Dragon Palace Chat Group\". After exchanging cultivation secrets from the immortal friends in the group, his cultivation level increased greatly. Since then, he has transformed into \"Luo Yuan Shangxian\" and started his journey of cultivating immortals between the human and immortal worlds. \n\nRelying on the information gap and witty planning of the immortal friends in the WeChat group, Luo Yun exchanged spicy strips for immortal pills and cola for spiritual treasures, constantly improving himself, helping the weak and upholding justice in the real world. As the Overlord Seafood Company rose all the way in the two worlds, Luo Yun was involved in the great dispute between Peach Blossom Spring and Chaos Star Sea because of the mystery of his life experience.\n\n(Source: iQIYI)",
