  "synopsis": "In the continent of Astraea, a man falls from the sky, possessing no memories other than his name, Yuuki. An elf named Kokkoro finds him, introducing herself as his guide in the world they are about to traverse. With Kokkoro's guidance, Yuuki is able to learn how this world works, from battling monsters to handling currency.\n\nTo earn money for their journey, Yuuki and Kokkoro decide to go to a nearby guild association to accept a simple quest. In their expedition, they meet Pecorine, a somewhat gluttonous but charming girl skilled in battle. The next day, they also meet Karyl, a cat girl specializing in magic.\n\nAfter some time, a bond of friendship and camaraderie forms between them, and the four decide to create a guild of their own. As they continue their adventures, they explore the world, meet new people, and will perhaps uncover the mysteries behind Yuuki's missing memories.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
