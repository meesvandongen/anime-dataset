  "synopsis": "Fame and fortune await those courageous enough to venture into the remote sectors of the planet. Largely uninhabited and covered by dense forests, these monster-infested regions are abundant in a mysterious ore called the Nova Stone. The coveted stone overflows with energy, and those successful in their hunt are bound to acquire obscene amounts of wealth. Yet the frontier remains a dreadful place. The only ones capable of staving off imminent devastation to human settlements are the hunters. Since their weapons, powered by Nova Stone, are capable of vanquishing the beasts, these brave souls are tasked with the protection of otherwise defenseless towns.\n\nOrphaned at a young age, Erika Amber was taken in by a huntress and raised as her successor. However, she is no ordinary human; her elven lineage has remained a mystery for Erika her entire life. Hoping to discover more about her ancestors, she ventures deep into the unexplored forests, leaving civilization behind. But before departing, she decides to visit Azul—the son of a recently deceased hunter—one last time. In a heart-to-heart talk, the boy reveals he admires the huntress and is deeply in love with her. As luck would have it, the feeling is mutual, and the memory of the passionate lovemaking that follows is likely to keep Erika warm during the long, chilly nights throughout her journey.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
