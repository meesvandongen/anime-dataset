  "synopsis": "The film's story begins with Shinnosuke and his friends of \"Kasukabe Defence Force\" experiencing a one-week stay in \"Tenkatouitsu Kasukabe Private Academy\" (nicknamed \"Tenkazu\"), an elite boarding school that is administrated by a state-of-the-art AI, \"Otsmun\". All the students are given a badge initially with 1000 points and their points are increased or decreased by Otsmun based on their behaviors and academic performance. In there someone attacks Kazama. As a result, his intelligence is reduced, and strange bite marks are left on his butt. The Kasukabe Defense Force joins forces with the school's dropout student council president Chishio Atsuki, who was a former athlete, to form a group of detectives and solve the mystery.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
