  "synopsis": "Hu Tutu, a confused and greedy kindergarten kid, has an unparalleled obsession with \"eating\". His dream is to eat delicious food all over the world. Tutu's mother is troubled by her son's \"nothing good\". Under the guidance of Jackie Chan's mother, Tutu, unable to withstand the temptation of food, embarked on the difficult road of the \"Little Chef God\" competition. After many tests, Hu Tutu, an ordinary child who was not optimistic by the organizers, won the championship unexpectedly and became a dazzling star in one fell swoop. Tutu's mother felt a sense of satisfaction and pride that she had never had before. The Tutu family has not yet enjoyed the happiness of being famous, but they are facing a sudden crisis of trust. \n\n(Source: Baike.baidu)",
