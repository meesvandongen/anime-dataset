  "synopsis": "On the Divine Forgotten Continent, hundreds of races clash, and warriors reign supreme. Jiang Yun, once the head of the Imperial City's Tianyi Martial Academy, was devastated by Ye Tianxie, turning a genius into a forlorn figure. Defying fate, he unexpectedly awakened his Sword Soul Bone. With the help of Jian Miaochan, the master of the sword path, he awakened his Eternal Sword Veins, becoming the only transcendent swordsman in the Mortal Realm. \n\nOriginally intent on dedicating himself to his training and swiftly slaying his enemies, Jiang Yun was targeted by his wife's childhood sweetheart, Ling Shaofeng. Ling Shaofeng rallied forces against Jiang Yun. Determined to protect his wife and the Tang family, Jiang Yun fought back fiercely, ultimately dismantling Ling Shaofeng and his forces and uncovering the Spirit Realm's plot to seize the Divine Forgotten Continent and exterminate humanity. For the sake of humanity, Jiang Yun was forced to temporarily set aside his hatred and join forces with his companions to resist the Spirit Realm's attack, ultimately saving the Divine Forgotten Continent and protecting humanity.\n\n(Source: Bilibili, Google translated)",
