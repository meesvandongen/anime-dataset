  "synopsis": "Mekakucity Records follows Mekakucity Days, and continues to tell the stories of the \"Mekakushi-dan\" members.\n\nYobanashi Deceive\nTonight, again, Shuuya Kano will tell a story. This is the story of a natural born liar, whose red-eye ability grants him the power to deceive, changing his appearance on a whim. But this poor boy no longer remembers his true self. Behind the mask is Kano himself, but this story is surely another lie... right?\n\nLost Time Memory\nIn one's life, there are many choices. Shintarou Kisaragi, haunted by the decisions of his past, locks himself in his room to cope. But still, he has choices. To persevere, he may finally be able to move on. Or will he remain in the past, only to drown in his regrets? No matter his choice, he will be forced to remember.\n\nAyano no Koufuku Riron\nAyano Tateyama's family expands when her parents adopt three red-eyed orphans. Sadness clings to these children, but Ayano wants to be the best big sister for them. Donning a red scarf, she shows the beauty of their red eyes and starts a secret club called the Mekakushi-dan. Ayano's family is her bliss, and she will do whatever it takes to protect their happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
