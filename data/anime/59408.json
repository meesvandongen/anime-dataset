  "synopsis": "One month after the Karakasa incident, the situation at the Inner Chambers is slowly returning to normal. To the noble families that run the country, normalcy means carrying on with their usual schemes to prevent any undesirable power shifts in the government. Their current target is the high-ranking concubine Fuki Tokita, who seems to be receiving Lord Tenshi's attention despite being the daughter of a merchant and, therefore, socially unfit to give him an heir.\n\nHowever, supernatural forces still dwell in the shadows. When several unnatural deaths take place in the Inner Chambers, its residents are once again forced to allow the presence of the mysterious Medicine Seller inside its halls. The Medicine Seller is the only one who might be able to determine the cause of these incidents—and find out what role Fuki plays in them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
