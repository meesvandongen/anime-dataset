  "synopsis": "For years, 14-year-old Masaki Hinaoka showed no interest in surfing, despite it being his best friend Nalu Tanaka's favorite pastime. But his mind changes in the blink of an eye when he encounters a blond boy surfing at sunrise. He finds the boy beautiful and graceful, awakening unfamiliar feelings that draw him toward the surfboard and ride the waves himself. The newcomer, Shou Akitsuki, gladly helps Masaki experience his first surfboarding feats.\n\nAlthough he cannot swim, Masaki exceeds his friends' expectations and shows incredible capability early on. This earns him a spot in a local competition, where he gets the chance to befriend other skilled surfers with unique styles and personalities, fueling his drive to improve. When a sudden tragedy strikes, however, all seems hopeless—but with the help of his newfound friends, Masaki continues to strive for success and to conquer the wildest of waves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
