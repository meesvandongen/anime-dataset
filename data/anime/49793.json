  "synopsis": "Elizabeth, Joou-sama Tsuihou no Hi!?\nIn a typical chess match against her sister ship Valiant, Queen Elizabeth confidently wagers her status as queen for a day, convinced she will remain undefeated. However, Valiant miraculously wins, taking this chance to assume the position she covets the most, even if only for a short while. On the appointed day, Queen Elizabeth experiences what it is like to live as one of her attendees. Meanwhile, Valiant realizes she is not prepared for the immense pressure of being a queen.\n\nElizabeth, Jinei Konshinkai ni Jinryoku\nThe long-awaited assembly of all nine Azur Lane factions is approaching. However, during the meeting of the factions' representatives, a consensus for the theme is reached in the absence of Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth and Iris Libre's Richelieu. As a result, no space is left for either faction to construct their stall on the event grounds. To ensure that the international gathering is a success, Queen Elizabeth takes it upon herself to convince the other factions to compromise for the sake of their beloved commander.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
