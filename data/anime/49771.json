Equipped with the legendary lance Leiptr and aided by Askr's summoner, Fjorm—Nifl's second princess—aims to defeat Surtr to put an end to the conflict.

To add to her misery, she loses one of her most precious tomes on the battlefield, leaving it to her loyal companion Xander to try cheering her up. Although his efforts initially end in failure, a mysterious staff he brought reveals to have magical powers, prompting Veronica to devise a scheme. She attempts another attack on Alphonse and the Summoner, using the power of the staff and her enormous Christmas spirit!\n\nFire Emblem Heroes: Book III - Chibi Playhouse\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",
