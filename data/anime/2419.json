  "synopsis": "Tenkai is a successful bar and restaurant located on a small European island run by an immigrant known affectionately as \"Miss China.\" In addition to running this well-loved establishment, she rents the upstairs unit to Jim, a young inventor who works alongside Mr. Breckenridge in the makeshift lab they have constructed there. The struggling pair are convinced that their scientific innovations will revolutionize the world in spite of the scorn they receive from the scientific community. However, as Miss China's patience wears thin due to their consistently overdue rent payments, Mr. Breckenridge and Jim must prove their work has value in order to avoid eviction.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
