  "synopsis": "A winter night during the war, a bomb maker was making bombs. He made many of them, and all of a sudden, one if them wakes up. \"I'm sorry to make you. You should live as you feel.\" The bomb was confused to his situation, born as a weapon, and went in to the woods. After a while, the war ends and one fire work lightens up the night.\n\n(Source: YouTube)",
