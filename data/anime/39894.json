  "synopsis": "Kumiko Oumae, the third-year president of the band club at Kitauji High School, is filled with anticipation and anxiety. She wonders what kind of new members will come to the club, whether she will be able to organize everyone as the band leader, and whether she will be able to achieve her long-sought goal of winning a gold medal at the national competition. With these thoughts in mind, Kumiko spends her days struggling as the head of the club, but even as a player, a big obstacle appears in front of her. Mayu Kuroe transferred from a strong school that regularly participates in national. The instrument in her hand is the same as Kumiko's; the euphonium. She is a perfect girl, adored by everyone around her for her gorgeous tone, excellent playing skills, and gentle personality. However, the shadow that Mayu sometimes casts over Kumiko makes her feel indescribable. \"Graduation\" is approaching for these youths who have devoted themselves to the brass band.\n\n(Source: Official Site, translated)",
