  "synopsis": "The hero mage Mo Fan and his partner Ling Ling, because of the mysterious invitation of the king of the hunt, become involved in an old unsolved case. After a series of explorations and pursuits, they realise that it is all a conspiracy hatched by a man named Red Beast. The Red Beast is growing up and approaching its ultimate goal by parasitising in the bodies of demons such as Yichu and Lu Kun. After a thrilling life-and-death battle, Mo Fan destroys the Red Beast with the help of Ling Ling, Wang Yue Qian Kaoru and other friends, only to discover that it is only one of its doppelgangers, and that he himself has long since become part of the Red Beast's plot!\n\n(Source: iyf.tv, translated)",
