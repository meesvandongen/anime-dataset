  "synopsis": "This is the Charisma House. Today, too, the charismatic men inside fixate solely on their own, unique Charisma.\n\nHowever, they've yet to discover \"True Charisma.\" Therefore, these Charismatic men have temporarily come to live under the same roof, embracing their Charisma and nurturing it to new heights with each passing day. Surely there are those in this world who might laugh at them. However, they're far too Charismatic to be affected. In fact, adversity becomes their fuel to further generate Charisma, allowing them to accumulate a splendid \"Charisma Charge.\" And awaiting once the Charge is full is…!?\n\nAn ordinary person simply couldn't understand, but this is the story of the Charismatic.\n\n(Source: Official YouTube video, Fandom translation)",
