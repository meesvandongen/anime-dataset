  "synopsis": "At a high school reunion, Mio Fukatani reunites with a classmate she has not seen in years—Takahide Kujou. She had always wanted to know more about the kind-hearted boy in high school, but once she realizes that Kujou has become a monk, she believes that any chance of getting to know him romantically is slim. Deciding to drink away her sorrows, she ends up walking home drunk, and surprisingly, running into Kujou who helps her get home.\n\nHowever, once inside, Kujou's lust for Mio becomes apparent and the two share an erotic night of passion. As this steamy romance blossoms between these two unlikely lovers, Mio and Kujou will undoubtedly spend many nights together in utter ecstasy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
