  "synopsis": "Things have been lively ever since Ranma Saotome took up residence in the Tendou household. He still turns into a girl whenever doused with cold water, but that has not stopped his unrelenting martial arts training and meeting countless new individuals. Moreover, Ranma and his fiancée, Akane Tendou, have grown closer despite their rocky start and constant quarreling.\n\nHowever, some people are not pleased with Ranma and Akane's engagement. A Chinese girl, Shampoo, is set on marrying Ranma, while he is also targeted by other men infatuated with Akane, who resort to anything to defeat him. Nevertheless, Ranma is determined to take on any challenger while navigating through his chaotic life with Akane.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
