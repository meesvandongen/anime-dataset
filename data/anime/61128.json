  "synopsis": "\"Orn Doula, today will be your last day in the party.\"\n\nOrn, once a skilled Swordsman, had adapted to the role of Enchanter to fill a crucial gap in the Hero Party. However, one day, the party leader abruptly dismisses him, claiming his skills are lacking. Branded a \"weakling\" and a \"jack of all trades, master of none,\" by his former comrades, Orn is cast out without a second thought.\n\nDetermined to start anew, he returns to adventuring—this time as a Swordsman, the role he originally excelled in. But his time as an Enchanter was far from wasted. The experience, knowledge, and countless original spells he developed in the Hero Party have forged him into a warrior unlike any other. Now, armed with an unconventional set of skills, Orn is ready to carve his own path—one that will prove his true strength to the world.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
