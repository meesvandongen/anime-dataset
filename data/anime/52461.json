  "synopsis": "Mitsuha Yamano could not have had it worse. After failing to enter her university of choice and losing her entire family in an accident, she finds herself plummeting off a cliff due to an especially fragile guardrail. Through what seems to be the only bit of the fortune left in her life, Mitsuha's firm unwillingness to die allows her to be transported to another world, where she ends up surviving.\n\nIn this foreign land, Mitsuha wanders around for days before collapsing from exhaustion and being rescued by a little girl named Colette. Not long after, she finds herself in yet another life-threatening situation, and her indomitable will shines once more, granting her an audience with a divine cosmic being. The entity reveals to Mitsuha that she has acquired not only superhuman regeneration but also the ability to transport between worlds at will.\n\nArmed with this new information, Mitsuha brainstorms ways to utilize her newfound power to its full potential. Realizing that she can take goods from Earth and resell them to the other world at a higher price, she resolves to save up eighty thousand gold coins to be able to retire comfortably.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
