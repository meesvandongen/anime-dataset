  "synopsis": "A civilization that disappeared in the dust, the ancient bosses sought their own way to become emperors. Jiang Hao, a modern young man who was originally a chess piece, stepped into the prehistoric wilderness in order to find the whereabouts of his father. With his incomplete \"power bank\" totem, he fought with people, from primitive tribes to the mysterious ancient city, he fought his way out; he fought with the earth, crossed the wilderness, hunted ancient beasts, and learned the ancient and mysterious totem witchcraft from the beasts; he fought with the sky, and the magic light from the sky suddenly appeared, wanting to devour this magnificent six wastelands. He went upstream, ignited himself, turned into the sun, and fought with the devil! He was shaking the world, but he didn't know that the shackles of fate had already trapped him, and his father's smile was still lingering.\n\n(Source: Youku, translated)",
