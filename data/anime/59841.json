  "synopsis": "Ever since dangerous gates leading to dungeons filled with monsters appeared on Earth a decade ago, humans gained a new way to provide for themselves: certain individuals designated as hunters received otherworldly powers to fight the dangers within. Sung Jin-Woo works desperately as a hunter to keep his family afloat. However, due to his lack of power, he is known as the weakest hunter of all mankind.\n\nDuring a dungeon expedition with his party, an unexpected disaster occurs, leaving Jin-Woo on the brink of death. Inexplicably surviving the grave situation, he wakes up in a hospital after the incident with a surprise—he has been selected as a player by a mysterious system, offering him possibilities to improve his skills. As he is seemingly the only one who has been chosen, Jin-Woo begins to level up at a fast pace, and he might just be able to become the world's strongest hunter with his reawakening.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
