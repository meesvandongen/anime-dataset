  "synopsis": "Locked into a relentless duel, cultivation experts Cang Di and Song Yu fight each other until both reach their final breaths. However, just before perishing, Song Yu finds a wandering soul and decides to use the last of his powers to revive it. Now placing his trust in this unsuspecting individual, Song Yu instills his own sword skills and medicinal knowledge onto the soul.\n\nTransmigrating into a cultivation world as Xu Wuzhou, the son-in-law of the Qin family, the wandering soul now finds himself in a slew of embarrassing troubles, thanks to the preposterous acts of his body's previous owner. Nevertheless, Xu Wuzhou is determined to prove himself a worthy member of the Qin family, and his newfound skills could be the secret to unlocking his full potential.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
