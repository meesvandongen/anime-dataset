  "synopsis": "Wang Xiaoxiu has been harboring feelings for his childhood friend, Shen Yao, for as long as he can remember. Now attending the same college, he is shocked to discover that Yao reciprocates his feelings. However, word spreads quickly about the two, and Xiaoxiu finds himself pursued by a delinquent group led by Sun Jun, who wants Yao for himself. While Xiaoxiu fights for his love, he ends up unconscious and falls into a river.\n\nAs Xiaoxiu wakes up, he is drawn to a strange light at the riverbed. When he makes contact with the object, it merges with his body, pulling him into another dimension. An unfamiliar voice introduces itself as the Horadric Cube and makes Xiaoxiu its new host. Fortunately for him, the cube comes with a pleasant surprise—he gains the power to teleport as well as improving his proficiency in fighting. Xiaoxiu must now collect various gemstones for the cube to absorb in order to gain even more strength to protect himself and the people he cares about from whatever dangers lie ahead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
