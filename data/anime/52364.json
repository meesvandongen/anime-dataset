Kagiura used to be anxious about his future dormitory life, but thanks to his energetic senior looking out for him, he has come to feel content and at ease. As he continues to rely on Hirano more and more each day, he develops strong feelings for his selfless friend. In the six months they have left as roommates, Kagiura is determined to put a name to the relationship he cherishes so dearly before it comes to an end. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
