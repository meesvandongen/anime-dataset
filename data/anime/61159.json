Now, at 40, reality has nearly caught up with him, and he's on the verge of letting go of his childhood fantasy.\n\nThat is, until he gets caught up in a crime wave led by the \"Fake Shocker\" gang—turning his long-time dream into something far more dangerous.\n\nWhat starts as a pretend hero's journey quickly becomes something real. The ultimate Kamen Rider fantasy is about to begin!\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
