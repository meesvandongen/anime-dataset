  "synopsis": "Enraptured by her upperclassman Makinohara's passion, Satsuki Amamiya joins the Photography Club along with her friend, An Kiriyama. Enthusiastic, Satsuki makes Makinohara the primary subject of her photography, taking several pictures of her daily. However, once Makinohara graduates and leaves the club in her hands, Satsuki decides to start fresh and purchases a 360-degree camera from an online auction.\n\nAlthough Satsuki and An's mutual passion blossoms with each new experiment, their club is in danger of dissolution due to a lack of members. They convince Sakurako Shikishima, the president of the Cinema Club, to join the newly formed Cinephoto Club. Accompanied by Sakurako and with the encouragement of their friend and manga artist, Haruno Akiyama, Satsuki and An continue to explore new places and capture precious memories they will never forget.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
