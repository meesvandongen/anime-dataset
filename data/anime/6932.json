  "synopsis": "Chacha Kenomoto wants nothing more than to be an ordinary high schooler, but she is hiding a secret—she can speak to cats. Often crass and rude, the cats around the neighborhood enjoy disrupting Chacha's day by following her everywhere she goes. While Chacha struggles to dodge the community cats' never-ending antics, her best friend Mito Azuma struggles to understand why Chacha believes her gift is more of a curse.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
