  "synopsis": "Team Typhoon, led by the talented but headstrong Taren Swift (something of a legacy in the Robot Dodgeball League due to his grandfather, Mr. Swift, being a founder of the sport), pairs up with Team Athlon in their search for a mysterious villain within the members of the Robot Dodgeball League.\n\nIt's not easy, but the two young pilots learn to work together and combine their respective strengths, and so do their Athlons! Dr. Hughes introduces integration technology to Alpha, Beta and Theta, who combine to form the impressive Champion. What's more, Dr. Hughes outdoes herself and designs a six-part integration involving Kyle and Taren's Athlons. Together, they form the massive and powerful Magma 6!\n\n(Source: Tobos Wiki)",
