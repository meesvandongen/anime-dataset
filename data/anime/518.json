To save the kingdom, the king sends his only daughter, Minky Momo, on a mission to restore humanity's dreams. After establishing herself as the daughter of a childless couple, Momo strives to transform Earth into a planet rich with dreams once more. Armed with the power to transform into an adult with the proper skills to handle any situation, and accompanied by her animal companions, Momo vows to succeed in her quest by any means necessary.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
