However, the arrival of transfer student Naruto Uzumaki—who declares that he wants to become the Yakuza boss of all Japan—drastically changes the high school's culture. Soon, Naruto faces off against just about every club captain and local thug, but his classmate Sasuke Uchiha leaves a deeper impression on him than anyone else.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
