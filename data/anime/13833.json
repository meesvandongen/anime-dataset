  "synopsis": "Risa Hanakago has always thought that falling in love makes the whole world sparkle. Although she longs to experience this herself, it seems futile without romantic prospects of her own. However, a chance encounter lands her in the sights of Touga Yuugure, a popular boy in her school. Charmed by each other, Risa and Touga quickly become a couple, but it remains unclear whether a relationship between a plain girl and a well-liked boy can last.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
