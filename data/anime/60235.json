As a result, he was frequently mocked and belittled. However, a fateful encounter altered the course of his life and destiny. Through an extraordinary process, he infused his body with rare gemstones, eventually attaining unmatched strength. This transformation set him on a journey to master the void and explore the far reaches of the universe.",
