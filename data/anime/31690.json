  "synopsis": "The story takes place on a faraway planet, called \"Chuu-Gakusei,\" where everything is in monochrome. The story follows Tanaka Satou, a junior high school teacher. All his students share the same name of Hiroshi Abe. Both the teacher and students wear a white, skin-tight garment that covers the entire body, including hands, feet and face.\n\nA new character, Black Teacher, is introduced and reveals the existence of the Kuro Chuu-Gakusei, an all-black version of the planet.\n\n(Source: The Asahi Shimbun)",
