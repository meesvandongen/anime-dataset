  "synopsis": "If there is one thing that magical girls like to do during their free time, relaxing in a hot spring is at the top of the list. But the dangers that await four magical girls at the hot springs differ greatly from the typical evils they fight against. While one of the girls tries to hide their true nature, the appearance of their unsavory older relatives puts further strain on what is supposed to be an enjoyable moment to unwind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
