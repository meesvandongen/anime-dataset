  "synopsis": "Prince Lloyd de Saloum—once a commoner who could never grasp magic—is now blessed with inexhaustible mana and has all the time in the world to master it, as he has no claim to the throne. After mastering demonic magic, he sets his sights on the Church to learn the secrets of divine magic that will bring him one step closer to completing his arsenal. However, due to his fondness for unholy magic, he draws the scrutiny of divine beings who see him as little more than a demonic spawn.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
