  "synopsis": "Virtual-san wa Miteiru is an anime that brings Virtual YouTubers to life.\n\nThe term Virtual YouTuber, or VTuber, refers to a YouTuber who shows themselves as an animated character, hiding their true appearance but still bringing joy to viewers. VTubers featured in Virtual-san wa Miteiru include Hime Tanaka and Hina Suzuki, who together make the rhythmic music duo HimeHina; Siro, the cyber girl, who definitely, certainly, positively has never murdered anyone; the lazy, FPS-loving Hinata Nekomiya; the upbeat Akari Mirai who sexually harasses her juniors; and the lightweight Mito Tsukino, who has a serious superiority complex.\n\nIn every episode these VTubers perform nonsense together in skits filled with slapstick, puns and fourth-wall-breaks. From the parody space adventure \"Virtual Wars\" to the nameless skit about bouncing gorillas, these absurdly funny segments are brimming with excitement. Virtual-san wa Miteiru is a one-of-a-kind comedy certain to bring delight to any fan of Virtual YouTubers!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
