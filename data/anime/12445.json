With no memory of her life or death, Yuuko discreetly finds and heads the Paranormal Investigations Club in search of answers.\n\nA chance meeting leads Yuuko to cling to diligent freshman Teiichi Niiya, who can see the quirky ghost. They quickly grow close, and he decides to help her. Along with Kirie Kanoe, Yuuko's relative, and the oblivious second year Momoe Okonogi, they delve deep into the infamous Seven Mysteries of the storied school.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
