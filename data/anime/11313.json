  "synopsis": "There was a time when Tokyo girl Yuzuki Eba abruptly decided to move to a tiny village outside of Hiroshima to attend high school. She lived in Haruto Kirishima's home, and gradually, they developed romantic feelings for each other. Then, Yuzuki left the village as suddenly as she arrived.\n\nSome time later, Haruto receives the opportunity to visit Tokyo for a school trip and wants nothing more than to meet up with Yuzuki. However, the two are nervous to see each other after such a long time, and Haruto's schedule leaves him with little in the way of free time. As they struggle to cross paths once again, Haruto and Yuzuki wonder if their long-distance relationship is worth the trials and tribulations they need to go through.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
