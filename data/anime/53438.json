  "synopsis": "Eight-year-old Pride Royal Ivy suddenly recalls her former life as a fan of the otome game Our Ray of Light. While on her way to replay it, she tragically died, reincarnating as the game's final boss and firstborn princess of Freesia. Her knowledge of the game's events leads everyone to believe she has the power of precognition. But unlike the game's original princess, this new Pride does not wish to torment those around her, such as her younger sister and adopted brother.\n\nHaunted by nightmares of her other self's atrocities, Pride resolves to protect her family and country while progressing the story. As the world around her changes, she prepares for the day she will have to die at the hands of the game's main characters. Nevertheless, before that happens, Pride will either transform her kingdom for the better or fall under the weight of her possible crimes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
