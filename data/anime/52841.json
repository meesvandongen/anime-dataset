  "synopsis": "In the realm of \"Another World\", ghosts are told to lead those spirits to the path of rebirth. However, one of these ghosts, Little Ghost, always loses track of what he is supposed to do. Perhaps it is not abnormal as nothing is ever destined to happen in this \"Another World\".\n\nIn a little forest in \"Another World\", Little Ghost is looking for his designated spirit and a little girl is in search for her younger brother. When Little Ghost who should have lost traits of humanity, encounters Little Girl that is reluctant to give up on finding her lost little brother, there is love and care growing between them. From that moment on, their paths will be bounded as Little Girl tries to right an unforgivable wrong about her lost brother while Little Ghost learns to realize the humanity from her.\nHowever, no matter how they are bond together, Little Girl has to leave for rebirth and Little Ghost is desperate to her stay. In \"Another World\", nothing remains unchanged.\n\n(Source: iamag.co)",
