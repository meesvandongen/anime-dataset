  "synopsis": "From nowhere, middle-aged illustrator Kenichi Hamada finds himself summoned to another world. Despite arriving in an unfamiliar land, he realizes he can still connect to an online shop named Shangri-La, which he frequented back in Japan, to order almost anything. Not long after, Kenichi comes across a town and, using Shangri-La, decides to become a merchant in the settlement.\n\nBy selling products from Earth, he is quickly able to make a living for himself while gaining acquaintances and the attention of local companies. However, the man just wants to live a quiet life without nuisances and leaves the town to build a cabin in a nearby forest. Though interrupted from time to time, there is nothing that can stop Kenichi from having his peaceful days.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
