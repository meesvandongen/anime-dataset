One day, her apartment gets connected to the two neighboring rooms through a \"hole\" in the wall.\n\nIn the room on the left is a fresh-faced yet mysterious guy who is overly-sweet to Rinko.\n\nThe room on the right is occupied by a guy with violent tendencies who is similarly mysterious... But wait! \"I... I think I know him!\" Rinko's only source of solitude, her apartment, has been turned upside down. Now, every day is full of heart-pounding surprises!\n\n(Source: MangaPlaza)",
